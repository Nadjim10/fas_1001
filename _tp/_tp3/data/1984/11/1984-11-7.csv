Thus far the meeting between the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) and President Reagan, followed by the meeting between the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Clark) and his American counterpart in Washington, have failed to produce the results promised by the Prime Minister.
We on the Liberal side of this House urge the Government to intensify its efforts, but also to show that we are determined to reach the goal of cutting emissions from smoke stacks and cars in Canada. Therefore I urge the Minister of the Environment (Mrs. Blais-Grenier) to continue to work in co-operation with the provinces, as initiated by the Liberal Government, and to convene as soon as possible a meeting with the provincial environmental Ministers so as to make further joint progress toward the modernization and clean up of dirty plants in Canada.
Finally, I urge the Minister of Transport (Mr. Mazankow-ski) to conclude consultations with industry and the public so as to control automobile emissions which contribute to acid rain.

A diagnosis revealed a country dying under a burden of excessive taxation and a rising debt of billions of dollars. Interest rates were killing investment and forcing farms and businesses into bankruptcy. A million people, including thousands of youths, were unemployed and looking for work but could find none because Canadians with
money were afraid to invest in their own country. They were heading elsewhere, taking their capital and jobs with them.
Ill will between the east and the west, between the English and the French, was festering. The country was breaking apart. Yes, indeed, we found a Canada sick unto death!
The Progressive Conservative Government, believing that a strong and united Canada is again possible, and with honesty, determination and free enterprise as their tools, are tackling the job, not with band-aids and aspirins, but by gradually removing the causes of the illness, by reducing the gigantic debt in an orderly way, thus forcing interest rates down, and by creating a climate of confidence so that thousands of entrepreneurs will invest their capital and hire Canadians.
A sickness which was neglected for ten years cannot be cured overnight, but now complete recovery will gradually take place and we will again have a strong and a united Canada led by a PC Government which represents all parts of the nation under that dedicated Canadian, the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney.

The Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Clark) and the Minister for External Relations (Mrs. Vezina) should be commended for their timely visit and intervention. However, Canada must become more conscious that Ethiopia is not a unique example. Africa holds 21 other countries with declining food capabilities. Their populations are growing faster than their per capita food productivity.
Shipping food to afflicted areas is a moral imperative which Canadians must accept in the short run, and, indeed, have shown themselves ready to accept. However, if other and equally tragic ""Ethiopias"" are to be avoided in the future, there is a greater need. We must make a sustained effort to enable the afflicted countries of Africa to expedite scientific agriculture and to develop vital infrastructures.
In 1975 it was predicted that 50 million people might starve to death within a decade. Never has a prophecy of doom been fulfilled with more horrendous accuracy. Never has a prophecy been more avoidable. Can the developed world now face a reality from which many turned away ten years ago? In the 18th century the western nations brought slavery to Africa. We now have a chance to renew its life.

While I applaud the Government for committing itself to extending the spousal allowance, it comes as a grave disappointment to me that it has ignored the more than 160 recommendations for reform, which were contained in the report of the Parliamentary Task Force on Pension Reform, a report, which I remind Hon. Members, had the concurrence of all three Conservative members on that committee.
Instead of concrete action the new Government has said it will ""enter into negotiations and discussions with the provinces for a comprehensive overhaul of the Canadian pension system, including such matters as portability, vesting, survivor benefits, and pension coverage for women"".
These are all much needed reforms and long overdue, but the Government was given a mandate on September 4 to change, not to study. The Canadian people do not want more discussions; they want action, and they want it now.
I therefore urge the Government to illustrate its commitment to pension reform by reforming the Canadian pension system and taking a lead role by tabling amendments to the federal Pension Benefits Standards Act.

I speak of the Canadian Oil Substitution Program-in other words, the new furnaces for old furnaces program-which puts $800 in your jeans if you convert from oil to gas or whatever, a program which subsidizes the relatively well off to buy heat pumps so their homes can be air conditioned in summer. The other is the CHIP program under which we pay home owners, certainly not the most poverty stricken in our society, $500 toward insulating their homes.
All forms of energy in Canada, Mr. Speaker, are now in surplus. World oil prices are falling, and producers are being directed not to produce. Indeed, they are being pro-rated. Why then spill out literally millions of taxpayers' dollars to those well enough off to own their own homes in order to encourage them to do what they ought to have done in the first place, to insulate; or to bribe them to buy new furnaces, heat pumps, and such devices. Surely there can be no justification for these programs.

We deeply regret that before taking such a decision, the government has not applied its philosophy of consultation. In the Speech from the Throne, there are many references to consultation and co-operation. The government referred to the importance of trade unions in Canada. However, their advice was not sought about the sale of those corporations. That is not the way an economic consensus can be reached. For the employees of such corporations, especially Canadair and de Havilland, that decision is quite dangerous. Many jobs could be lost. Mr. Speaker, we ask the government to consult the employees of those corporations.

It was a commitment to work toward achieving economic equality for all women.
I would like to bring to the attention of this House an example where immediate steps can be taken to redress a situation existing today which blatantly discriminates against the women of Canada.
Existing regulations of the Armed Forces of Canada allow members, both male and female, to claim sick leave without any loss in pay, without any loss in seniority or vacation leave, and without any loss in their pension contributions, for anything from hangovers to facelifts.
When a member of the same Armed Forces becomes pregnant, however, time lost as a result of that pregnancy results in the loss of pension benefits, loss in seniority, and loss of pay. Her record is marred in terms of future promotions, and being put on leave without pay has quite a stigma attached to it.
The previous Government, aware of such blatant discrimination, had years to address this problem and failed to do so. I call upon the new Government, committed to achieving economic equality for women, to introduce immediate steps to bring the Armed Forces up to date and into the 20th century.

I was pleased to be joined in that mission by representatives of the other Parties represented in this House. Certainly, for my part and, I believe, for theirs, we are confident that the Government and authorities of Ethiopia are doing everything that is possible in very difficult circumstances to ensure that aid that comes from the rest of the world to help starving people in Ethiopia will get to those people.
There is conflict internally in Ethiopia. Undoubtedly there will be some diversion. My view is that that is minor and on the margins and it should not deter the people of Canada from giving the aid that is necessary. I am looking for reasons to encourage Canadians to give aid that will help the starving. I am not looking for reasons to stop that aid. I think that is the view of all Members in the House.

However, in saying that I should like to express the surprise and disappointment of many people in western Canada at the total lack in the Throne Speech of any reference to the serious drought conditions faced by farmers in that area.
Would the Hon. Minister and his Government consider bringing into the House today, with the full co-operation I am sure of all Hon. Members on this side, the proposals made last
November 7, 1984

summer by the previous Government to bring in advance payments under the Western Grain Stabilization Fund so that some $500 million of cash flow wouuld be in the hands of farmers to meet a very serious problem before the change of the fiscal year? This is something which western farmers have been expecting and planning for, Mr. Speaker. We would hope the Minister of Agriculture will prevail upon his colleagues so that we could have that Bill in the House right away.

Indeed, I think that he can take some satisfaction from the fact that the agricultural industry was mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. It was selected as one of our resource industries which we should make every effort to strengthen and to revitalize.
With reference to the Hon. Member's question drawing our attention to the very serious drought conditions in western Canada, we are very much aware of them. Indeed, one of my first trips after being sworn in as Minister of Agriculture was to Regina where I sat down with my provincial counterparts, along with my colleagues, the Minister of Transport and the Minister of State in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board. An agreement between the federal Government and the provinces, to the extent of $60 million, was signed. We have not ignored the drought conditions in western Canada. We have addressed this as well as we can, given our limited financial resources.

My colleague, the Hon. Member for Comox-Powell River, reported on both to our caucus this morning.
My question does concern what Canada is doing about aid to the starving people of Ethiopia. It is not enough for the Minister to say, as he did earlier, that David MacDonald is looking after it. David MacDonald is co-ordinating it, not instigating it. Has the Government yet instigated a special fund drawn from new moneys, and not from transfers from other moneys in CIDA or elsewhere, for emergency aid and development in Ethiopia?

No greater honour can be paid to a Canadian than to have been elected by his fellow citizens to the forum of the nation, to the highest court of the land, this Parliament. I am immensely grateful to the people of Vancouver Quadra and I undertake, Mr. Speaker, to serve them to the best of my abilities, to lead and rebuild a great national Party and to lead that rebuilding from western Canada.
I am grateful, as I have said, to the citizens of Quadra. They have stood up against a national tidal wave to give me the privilege of serving them in this House and I am proud, once again, of the efforts made by my supporters, my wife, my sister and my children and the sacrifices they have undergone in order to facilitate my return to public life.

Mr. Speaker, each one of us has the important duty of providing, to provide proper representation for our constituents. Together, we have a duty to serve to the best of our ability the interests of all Canadians. Everyone of us has or should acquire a profound and indestructible respect for the traditions of the House. We rely on you, Mr. Speaker, to preserve and safeguard those traditions.

As well, I would like formally, as I have personally, to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) on his impressive election victory.

Having been in the same position many years ago, I am fully aware of the importance of a Member's maiden speech in the House, and I think the Hon. Members did a remarkably good job. I trust we shall have further occasion to hear them in the House during this session. [English]
We are here, Mr. Speaker, for a purpose greater than partisan loyalties. We are here to defend and preserve the democratic institutions of this country, of which this House is by far the most important. A former Opposition Leader and Prime Minister, the Right Hon. John George Diefenbaker, had this to say in this House. These are his words:
Mr. Speaker, this institution must not fail. Without it there is no freedom. We are here today not only as the custodians of the present and the inheritors of the past, but Mr. Speaker, we are here as well as the hope of this institution's future.
On behalf of the members of my caucus, I promise you, Mr. Speaker, that we will uphold what Mr. Diefenbaker had in mind. But I promise you and the members of the Government that we will be a strong and vigilant Opposition.

We interpret our position here as recognizing that the people of Canada did accord to the Right Hon. Prime Minister and his colleagues and supporters a massive mandate. But such was the nature of what they said, what they undertook and what they promised, so vague were those undertakings, that we do not extend that approval to any particular piece of legislation and we undertake to examine with care every Bill which comes before this House. If it is good legislation, it will have our approval and pass quickly. If we believe it needs improvement, then we will propose changes and amendments. If we feel it is not in the
best interests of the people of Canada, we will oppose it and oppose it vigorously. I might add that we will not oppose just for the sake of opposing. We do not propose to be, as was contemplated by the Prime Minister in an interview he gave to Val Sears of The Toronto Star, ""purely destructive"".
I represent a political party which is a party of reform and innovation, a party of openness, with a willingness to experiment with new ideas. We will respect the rights of the individual and the rule of law. We will defend the social contract. We will work to preserve our social programs with special attention to those in greatest need. I want to remind the Prime Minister that he said during the election campaign, and I use his words, that universal social programs are ""a sacred trust not to be tampered with"". We on this side of the House, the Official Opposition, will hold him to that particular commitment.

Liberals respect the right of every individual Canadian to develop to his or her greatest potential. We believe in equality of opportunity and access to education, training and job opportunities regardless of family background, colour, creed or sex. My colleagues and I believe in providing the widest possible scope for individual initiative and reward for success. But we also believe fundamentally in protection for those who need help or suffer through no fault of their own.

Liberalism, Mr. Speaker, believes strongly in private enterprise but holds that governments should play a positive role in the marketplace where private capital cannot do the job or where the public interest demands such an intervention. We believe that the role of government is to support and encourage private initiative and to provide the framework in which it can grow and create the thousands of jobs we need. Liberalism is not static because the world is not static. Liberalism is pragmatic and not doctrinaire.

Liberalism is not rigid for socialist nor single interest dominated. Liberalism rejects monopoly power, whether it is exercised by business, cults, unions or majorities.
A liberal understands that political freedom is impossible without economic freedom. Economic security is necessary for the full development of human personality and human fulfilment.

Liberals are never content with today. We accept change and we seek it. We believe in reform and we fashion it. We
November 7, 1984

believe, indeed, that the world truly can become a better place to live.

I think Sir Wilfrid Laurier probably gave the best definition of Liberal doctrine when he spoke to the Reform Club in Quebec, in the old capital of Quebec, in the following terms, and I quote:
I am a Liberal, that is, I believe that in this world, there is abuse that must be stopped, there are new horizons to be discovered and new forces to be developed.
Mr. Speaker, the programs introduced by the Liberals over the years are a reflection of Laurier's vision: health insurance, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, the guaranteed income supplement, family allowance, funds made available to educational institutions under established programs financing, on-the-job training for youth, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Student Loans Act, a bill I had the privilege of presenting here in the House at the time.

There was a question, Mr. Speaker, directed by my colleague, the Hon. Member for Hamilton East (Ms. Copps), concerning the commitments of the Prime Minister and the Government to the women of this country. There are indeed, as the Prime Minister observed, more women Members in this House today than ever before. I congratulate each and every one of them in every quarter of the House. I congratulate them no matter what partisan loyalties they may share, and 1 urge the women of this country to stand in greater numbers for public office, for Parliament, for the legislatures and for the municipalities.

We must allow women, by way of legislation and precedent, to have the freedom to choose how they want to live, whether they want to fulfil their careers at home or in the workplace, or both, either full time or part time.
The rules by which this Party will govern legislation affecting women are those of fairness, equality, equity and a real partnership in this country. This Party has always fought and will continue to fight to improve the position of women, whether they work at home, outside the home, or both. We believe in the full equality of women, we believe in equal pay for work of equal value, and we believe that the Human Rights Commission should take a more activist role in making that principle a reality. As my colleague from Hamilton East pointed out, it is the law; it is now up to the federal Government and its agencies to ensure that the law is fulfilled in the federal Public Service, in federal Crown Corporations and in those who fall within federal jurisdiction.

Action!""
We need adequate funding for day care. We do not need any more studies on day care such as the Throne Speech proposes. We need adequate funding for day care.
The Loyal Opposition will support an amendment to the Indian Act affecting Section 12(1 )(b). I am glad that the Government intends to make that a priority.
We on this side believe in improving the enforcement of maintenance orders across the country and hope that the legislation contemplates something in that respect. We believe that the Government should follow up the Badgley Report on sexual abuses.
We believe that the Government should continue what we were doing in conducting an audit of all federal and provincial legislation to ensure that it accords with the Charter amendment which will become effective on April 17 next year affecting equality of women. There should be an active audit of every piece of federal and provincial legislation led by the Attorney General.
We also believe in affirmative action and equal access to training, jobs, opportunities and career options. I have been on record, Mr. Speaker, on this subject. We do not believe in a quota system. We believe in a merit system. We believe women ought to have an opportunity to qualify for merit as we believe they easily will. In this respect we will be watching what the Government does on affirmative action because we expect the publication of the Abella Report later this month or next month and we will be watching the Government's response to that particular report.
The cultural heritage of this country must be defended and preserved, Mr. Speaker. There is no longer a majority and a minority in Canada. We are all minorities and the time has come for total accessibility by way of statute, precedent or regulation for all Canadians in business, government and the unions, no matter what their creed, colour, faith or sex, and no matter how long they have lived in this country. In the past Liberal Governments have pursued progressive and humane immigration policies which have enriched the heritage of this country. We have stressed policies which underline the reunification of families. We have welcomed political refugees from Poland, Chile, Vietnam and other countries.
With the greatest respect, the Throne Speech touched only lightly on the subject of multiculturalism. I note, for instance, that there was no mention of compensation or acknowledgement to the Japanese Canadians for the treatment they received during World War II. The Prime Minister proposed that earlier this year. It was also the last question which he happened to direct to my predecessor when my predecessor sat in his seat in the House of Commons. The issue of acknowledgement and the redress which I believe Japanese Canadians are entitled to did not receive mention in this Throne Speech. I

November 7, 1984
The Address-Rt. Hon. John Turner hope that we will learn of the Government's position on this issue before very long.

I am happy to see that the Speech from the Throne contains a commitment to preserve both official languages and to protect language minorities throughout Canada. I note that the Government intends to honour its constitutional commitments to our aboriginal peoples. As we all know, these commitments were laid down in the Canada Act, 1982. They are constitutional commitments. However, this throne speech does not mention any progress with respect to aboriginal government, land claim settlements and other issues of interest to Canada's native peoples. We had hoped for more on this subject-

We are going to press for the fulfilment of the Penner Report. The Hon. Member still sits with us. We are going to press the Government to move toward allowing our Indian, Metis and Inuit people to move toward more self-government and more self-reliance and to assure them the dignity to which they are entitled. I regret very much that the Throne Speech did not address this particular concern.
We on this side would also have hoped for more reference in the Throne Speech to the development of all regions of the country, and for more special emphasis on correcting regional disparities and equalizing opportunities across the country. Where was mention of that in the Throne Speech? What support was there for building up the industrial sectors of this country? Why was that not in the Throne Speech?
I have travelled widely in western Canada since the election, Mr. Speaker. I gave a commitment to the people of British Columbia and the other western provinces that I would do my best to ensure that any government would bring western Canadians into the decision-making process and that that feeling of frustration, alienation and impatience could somehow be dissipated by allowing westerners to become more fully represented. I also gave an undertaking that I would make the Liberal Party more relevant again in western Canada. That is an essential priority for me. Canada is not just an Atlantic nation, Mr. Speaker. Canada is an Arctic nation and a Pacific nation. New prosperity in western Canada depends upon the Pacific Rim. Our trade, tariff and transportation policies must reflect this new reality and new direction. I congratulate the Government for making some reference to it in the Speech from the Throne.
Our Party, Mr. Speaker, stands for an independent foreign policy for Canada. We must have close relationships with all our friends and allies. We must keep our NATO commitment. However, we must never simply mimic American policy. Those are grand words in the Throne Speech about restoring ""goodwill, partnerships"" and ""fruitful co-operation"" with the United States. I am all for that. I echo those sentiments, but not at the expense of Canadian political sovereignty, the independence of our foreign policy or our cultural or economic integrity.

I am glad that the Government intends to continue the initiatives of the previous Government to upgrade our contribution to the NATO alliance. At the same time, we must not lose sight of the fact that while a strong defence is desirable and necessary, the ultimate goal we seek is peace. It is disappointing and I find it incomprehensible that the Throne Speech does not mention any commitment to the peace initiative of my predecessor, the Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau.
[ Translation]
Mr. Trudeau has won tremendous respect and admiration in Canada for his efforts to establish a reasonable dialogue on the nuclear arms race. I have met many groups and discussed with them the very active role Canada can play in the search for peace. We shall be keeping a very close watch on the Government's activities in this area.
The throne speech mentioned the tremendous problems facing Third World countries. I would urge the Prime Minister at this point to ensure that Canada will continue to play an important role in reducing the economic gap between North and South.

I welcome the study of a parliamentary committee on Canada's role in the world, but what are we going to do in the meantime? I hope that the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Clark) will enlighten us in the House at an early opportunity as to what his views and those of the Government are and what priorities and new direction the Government intends to pursue. If this is a Government by study, let them have their study; but I would hope that the Minister, who has travelled widely and once held high public office, would honour us with his thoughts on an early occasion in this House.

During that election the Prime Minister, his colleagues and his candidates across the country showered an avalanche of promises on the heads of the people of Canada. We tried to count them. We gathered 338 together in a booklet.
I am sorry that the Minister of Justice (Mr. Crosbie) is not here. He put a price tag of $20 billion on those promises and then thought that that might have been generously low. We on this side of the House in the Liberal Party did not believe that
November 7, 1984

the time was right for lavish political promises because the public debt was so high. We knew it and the Prime Minister knew it.
I would like to cite the Prime Minister as quoted in the Financial Post of March 4, 1984. He said we must-[DOT]
-deal with some degree of prudence and frugality with public spending, which is completely out of hand.
When I opened the campaign in Edmonton I set out clearly for the people of Canada the fact that the huge public debt meant that 33 cents out of every tax dollar collected by the people of Canada through their federal Government is now necessary to pay interest. Therefore I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that the Conservative Party knew the facts, the Prime Minister knew the facts, but they went ahead anyway and made those promises. We will remind the Government on every relevant occasion about those commitments to the people of Canada and we will remind our fellow citizens about them as well.
I do not want to anticipate, nor do the rules allow me to anticipate, what the Prime Minister, the right hon. gentleman, will say this afternoon. I have heard his colleague, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), and we can hear him tomorrow. He will say, as he has already said, that the cupboard is bare. He will say that the situation is, to use his words, ""even worse than we had anticipated"". That simply will not wash.
Let me quote Allan Maslove, Director of Carleton University's School of Public Administration. In his words the bare cupboard theory is ""a bunch of nonsense"". The Conservatives knew the situation. They had the same numbers that we had and they were able to see the same forecasts that were available to us in both the private and public sector. But they chose to ignore them.

I also said during the election campaign that if the Progressive Conservatives ever came to power, they would have only three choices. They would either have to renege on their promises, raise taxes or cut our social programs. Mr. Speaker, they never had the slightest intention of keeping those promises, because they knew the state the country's finances were in.

They might say on the basis of the polls that they like to receive that promises are just words. That only adds to the cynicism with which Canadians tend to view their elected representatives. I tend to believe that it is a question of trust. It goes to the heart of a parliamentary democracy that governments should do what they say they will do, and if they do not they are not fulfilling the mandate which was given to them by the people of Canada.
The Government is now faced with these three options: renege or welch on those promises, raise taxes, or cut into our social programs. That is the position in which the Government has put itself. That is the position about which we will remind the people of Canada. There are a lot of IOUs out there.
The Address-Rt. Hon. John Turner
I wonder what Peter Lougheed and Premier Devine are saying to the new Prime Minister. I am sure that the Province of Alberta expects the Government to keep its word on market prices for energy. We will wait and see what the Premier of Ontario has to say about that, if he is still saying anything about anything. You can be sure, Mr. Speaker, that the big blue machine that was donated free of charge for the campaign will soon come calling here on the Hill for some of its demands. We will be interested to see how the Prime Minister responds to that.
What has the Government been doing since September 17? There is an old saying which is: ""Actions speak louder than words"". There are many words in the Throne Speech but very little action. However, in the case of the Government, it is also a case of say one thing but do another.
The Conservatives promised us lean and efficient government. Those were their words. They have given us the largest federal cabinet in history. Restraint is for others. Restraint is for ordinary Canadians, not for that gang. It is the largest government in the history of this country.
I know that the cabinet choices were difficult. There are the blue Tories and the red Tories. To use the vocabulary of the Prime Minister's friend, Margaret Thatcher, the Government has its ""wets"" and its ""drys"". If you look, Mr. Speaker-and you should-it is plain that most of the wets in the caucus ended up high and dry.
It is true that the Government has tried to cut down. It has eliminated the foreign affairs and defence committee of cabinet. There are already winners and losers. To use the Prime Minister's words, he promised Canadians ""jobs, jobs, jobs"". What did we get? Cut, cut, cut and freeze, freeze, freeze.
The Prime Minister said at Prince Albert as he announced the great Prince Albert charter-and I alluded to this earlier in my question-that ""You are going to see tens upon tens of thousands of jobs being created just as quickly as a new government can be sworn in"". Where are those jobs? What did the Conservatives do? The minute that they were sworn in their policy was to cut, cut, cut and freeze, freeze and freeze. The Government froze the Special Recovery Projects that were necessary to get the economy moving and put Canadians back to work. It killed the First Chance program which would have given on-the-job training to 100,000 young Canadians a year. In its place it produced a pilot program for 3,000 or 4,000 young people, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon. While we offered a first chance for young Canadians, the Government is offering little more than a fat chance. It says not to bother it now but come back later; it says: ""Let us see you in the Spring"".

We do not know the purpose for these actions and perhaps the right

November 7, 1984
The Address-Rt. Hon. John Turner hon. gentleman, the Minister sitting attentively in the House, will advise us on an appropriate occasion.
I am sorry that the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion (Mr. Stevens) is not here. He is conducting a fire sale on Crown Corporations such as de Havilland, Canadair, Eldorado, TeleGlobe, and apparently Fishery Products International, according to yesterday's release. There is also some suggestion about getting out of Petro-Canada. All of this is being done without any study or analysis of what the impact of the sale of these firms would be. If there is anything that needs more study it is this. I hope we will know the Government's position very soon.
I asked questions about these sales. What are the terms? Who is eligible to buy these corporations? Will foreign companies be allowed to own our aircraft industry? Who assumes the debt? What will be the impact of these sales on Canadian technology and Canadian jobs?
I remember when the Right Hon. John George Diefenbaker sat in the House. He regretted for a long time the sale of A.V. Roe and the closing down of that plant.
Even the Hon. Member for St. John's East (Mr. McGrath), a former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, said the following about the proposed sale of one Crown corporation: ""There is as much chance of Fishery Products International being sold to the private sector as me going to the moon"". I do not know if the Hon. Member is here but he ought to check with Marc Garneau.

These important economic changes are not even mentioned in the throne speech. They should be debated in the House, because they are too important to be left to the discretion of one minister. I hope the Minister of Finance will give full attention to these issues in his economic statement tomorrow. [English]
The promise of lean government seems to apply to everyone but the Government itself. Restraint is for others. Its ministry of 40 is the largest in Canadian history. The first thing the Government did was almost double the budgets for Ministers' political staffs.

As the session goes on, maybe the price will be higher.
One of the most important programs in our country is medicare. It is being threatened by user fees and extra billing. During the campaign the Prime Minister had an answer, which I will quote:
The answer is clearly, in the circumstances, more money to maintain the services ... and it's a question of where your priorities are.
Obviously the protection of medicare is not a priority with this Government. It is not even mentioned in the Throne Speech.
The Prime Minister indicated a willingness to address the issue of pensions for homemakers. He made a commitment in the debate on national television affecting womens' issues, but there is no mention of homemakers' pensions in the Throne Speech.
There were 39 specific promises made by the Progressive Conservatives in the energy area. Not a single one received even an honourable mention. In fact, the whole energy sector was ignored. I think this is what the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Miss Carney) admitted during the election campaign, that was that quiet little accord with the provincial ministers-this is carrying it a little too far. We could at least have heard something in the Throne Speech as to the direction of this Government. Farmers and fishermen at least get a passing reference. But where is the promise to change the advance payments crops Act to double cash advance levels?

November 7, 1984
The Address-Rt. Hon. John Turner
We realized the necessity, as the Hon. Member for Win-nipeg-Fort Garry (Mr. Axworthy) said in Question Period, to trigger a further payout of $500 million in advance payments under the Western Grain Stabilization Plan. The Prime Minister's colleague, the Premier of Saskatchewan, says even that is not enough. When will the Government tell western farmers what they can expect? Where is the promise to remove the 9 per cent federal sales tax on diesel fuel and gasoline used by farmers and fishermen? Where are the 46 specific promises to our multicultural communities? They are not there.
Where are the commitments to regional development, that special assistance to the Atlantic Provinces announced in Halifax? They are not there. Where are the commitments to housing? Housing starts have dropped by 14,000 this October. What does the Government intend to do? Where is the commitment to remove the capital gains tax on the transfer of farm land? Farms in western Canada are immobilized until the Government makes up its mind and the Minister of Finance tells us whether or not that commitment will be fulfilled. Where is the commitment to roll back the freight rate increases on grain for western farmers? Where is the commitment to freeze rail line abandonments?

The point is: it is fine to make grand gestures during election campaigns, but the real acid test begins today. I say to the Prime Minister: ""What are you going to deliver to the people of Canada?""
The Minister of Finance just told us today that in his economic statement tomorrow there will be expenditure cuts. We are seeing the plan as it develops, the old one-two punch- first, the Throne Speech to try to soften us up, and then tomorrow the knock-out punch in this financial statement. Maybe when Canadians pick themselves up off the floor on Friday morning we will have at last a clear indication of where the Government will take us.
Tremendous expectations were raised during the campaign. What we are presented with in the Throne Speech is a series of consultations. It is government by study, by seminar.

There are no new goals to inspire us,
no new directions in which to lead us. Instead we are presented with a long list of studies, consultations, consensus and process.
That is not leadership. Studies are not action. Process is not an agenda for progress. The Prime Minister and his Party have a massive majority. We can see it in this House.

November 7, 1984



How things change after an election, Mr. Speaker! The ""common man"" from Shawinigan has become the spokesman for Bay Street. How extraordinary! A revolution! As legal adviser, he will undoubtedly defend the interests of the multinationals and American corporations. What a dreadful omen for the future!

I was impressed by the ringing declaration of the Leader of the Opposition to the effect-and I think I got it right-that governments, it was said, should always do what they say they are going to do, with just about that degree of emphasis.
The Throne Speech of 1980 given by the then government contained the following words, and I paraphrase but modestly: ""18 cents a gallon is too much"". ""We must reduce the rate of unemployment"". It was 800,000 then and it rose to 1.5 million. ""We are going to arrest the growth in the size of government"". It was $60 billion per year then. It is $100 billion now and climbing every day as a result of their mismanagement. Then the big one in the Throne Speech: ""Elect us and we are going to reduce the deficit in a planned and orderly way"". It was because of four solemn undertakings made and violated by the Liberal Party that the Canadian people placed not the Right Hon. Leader of the Opposition, because he was not here, but his colleagues in opposition for a long, long time.

In terms of improvements, there are many. I will not list them today, but one of the dramatic improvements that have been made since the new Government took office has been the quality of some of the ambassadors appointed. Yesterday, in a moving speech by Stephen Lewis, the new Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, with regard to Ethiopia and the problems of Africa, he cut out and set out important policies and views. He spoke movingly of the situation in Africa.

This relationship is a cornerstone of our foreign policy which will help us in establishing and maintaining warm and fruitful relations with France at all times and under all circumstances.

I do not mean to be unduly critical today. Even if I tried to be critical of the previous Government, I could not do as good a job as was done by the Leader of the Opposition during the Liberal leadership convention. He was tremendous: deficit spending, declining productivity, declining commitment to research and development, abusive treatment of the private sector, the 1981 Budget, the MacEachen Budget, the NEP which just about extinguished the entrepreneurial spirit and debilitated the private sector.
We are going to re-energize the private sector in this country because that is the way new jobs are created.

-reverse his stand in the middle of the election campaign, when, after he had made serious and important comments about the National Energy Program, he went to Halifax, and, probably after consulting with Senator Davey, who is also from Bay Street and who is here today, said that he was in favour of the National Energy Program.

It was an astonishing conversion and a debilitating one. That kind of retroactive provision is odious. Canadian wealth, prosperity and new opportunities are not built on confiscating somebody's property.

Nor was he responsible, but this is the heritage, for the downgrading of our military obligations, the churlish and vexatious treatment of the United States of America, our greatest friend, neighbour and ally, the United Kingdom and others.
We were left with unemployment at tragically high levels, an industrial base that had been gravely eroded and to which the Leader of the Opposition quite properly addressed his considerable ideas and force of character during the leadership campaign. The industrial base of the country was gravely eroded, and has been. The private sector has been undercapitalized and unappreciated by a series of these governments.
Today, not a word of contrition, not a single little mea culpa for what has happened to the country, not an ounce of humility. The Liberal Party has been wiped out in the provinces,
reduced to a rump here and we do not get even a little 'I'm sorry*. I am not asking for much, just a little bit of an acknowledgement that indeed perhaps the Liberals were not-

-in secure possession of the truth at all times. They are perhaps somewhat less perfect that the Hon. Member from Papineau (Mr. Ouellet) used to say occasionally! But that is not the point. I must respectfully say that I do not see how the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Turner) can have the gall to criticize us for anything after having been with his colleagues in power for 20 years. As for us, we have only been in power for two months, but I can tell you this: Give us 20 years, and it is coming, and you will not recognize this country. Moreover, the whole area of federal-provincial relations will also be completely changed.
The Leader of the Opposition belittles the process of consultation and the notion of respect toward the provinces that are mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. We believe that these are important and even vital gestures in a federal state, and that we cannot operate without healthy and dignified consultations. This must be understood.
The Hon. Member for the Thousands Islands, who has been named his deputy for Quebec, accused me during the election campaign, and this shows the mentality of that party. The Hon. Member for the Thousands Islands, who is here today, said in an important speech in Quebec that the then Leader of the Opposition-

To speak about Orangemen is to bring back a lot of nonsense from the 1940s. In fact, that was the traditional bogeyman of the Liberal Party in 1940. I think that after sober consistera-tion the people in Quebec and in the rest of Canada came to the conclusion that they were going to put an end to the monopoly of the Liberal Party over the francophone vote in this country. Enough of that nonsense! We are going to vote for a new party and a new prosperity in Canada.
I regret to say that the Leader of the Opposition went to Quebec and found three separatists. Three. As for me, I discovered a population saddened by such statements and determined to reject them and to respond to the call for unity and progress. The people of Quebec and Canada decided that, since it was harbouring such harmful attitudes, the Liberal Party needed a period of rest, of reorientation and of renewal which might last a long time.
November 7, 1984

I have already conveyed to my friend, the Hon. Leader of the New Democratic Party, my regrets at having to leave somewhat early to go to the airport to welcome the Prime Minister of France. However, before concluding I simply want to say that the agenda before the House as set out in the Throne Speech strikes me as being reasonable, appropriate and fair for the country. We seek an end to confrontation. We seek an end to division and conflict. We seek a new era of co-operation and understanding.
I am fully aware of the limitations of the thought itself. I know that there will be difficult moments. 1 think, for example, of the area of federal-provincial co-operation in which, for 15 years, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador asked for one thing of the Government. They asked for an honourable deal in the offshore and they were told consistently either to do it the Liberal Government's way or it would not be done at all. We applied the great traditions of building upon regions and, understanding the vitality and the necessity of that strength and in a spirit of honourable compromise, we went to Newfoundland-and we will be back again-to conclude an arrangement with Newfoundland and Labrador with regard to the development of that magnificent resource, in the firm belief that people from Newfoundland are entitled to fairness as well and that what is good and prosperous for Newfoundland is good for Canada.

And we have approached the West exactly the same way. We are going to negotiate with Ontario and Quebec. We are, however, going to stop building judo clubs in Quebec churches. That was a hobby of the Member for Papineau (Mr. Ouellet). We are going to or at least we shall try to reach some kind of agreement with the elected government of Quebec, and start a reasonable and intelligent dialogue in order to create jobs for Quebecers and Canadians. That is this Government's mandate, both in Quebec, Alberta and Newfoundland, and we intend to fulfil that mandate.

There is no suggestion, Mr. Speaker, not today nor during the election campaign, that we pretend to have all of the answers. We recognize the seriousness of the problems. May I say parenthetically to my right hon. friend that in regard to the litany that he not improperly set out, there was a very important caveat made in Prince Albert, in Sherbrooke and in Halifax. If he takes the time to read the statement that I released that day, he would see that we indicated that these programs and policies were good for Canada and would be introduced in a timely manner depending upon the state of the finances as we found them.

Edward Broadbent (Oshawa):,,"SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B), 1984-85 REFERENCE TO STANDING COMMITTEES",SPEECH FROM THE THRONE,RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my comments by referring to the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) in a way that he will well understand. What I am about to say is not said in any mean spirit, but rarely have I heard a former truck driver talk so much about Bay Street, or a prime minister say so little about his Throne Speech.
I do want to begin, most sincerely, by congratulating both the mover and the seconder of the motion. These two Members spoke well, seriously and with conviction. I congratulate them on their beginnings in this Parliament.
I would like to speak about what I thought would be the substance of the debate-the future of Canada. Instead, what we had was a rehash of an election campaign which I thought had been put behind us. In that connection I say that the Throne Speech should assess the problems of a nation, regional, between groups and between individuals, and it should lay out in general terms a new Government's approach to those problems. It should not pretend to provide all the answers, but it should at least pretend to set a new direction and provide a new beginning for the nation following an election.
Without belabouring the problems-because the people of our country know the problems-I would like to indicate some of the matters which, in the view of my colleagues, and I think the vast majority of Canadians, ought to be addressed by this Parliament. Most of the problems ought to be addressed before the House adjourns for the Christmas break. I do not mean

November 7, 1984
The Address-Mr. Broadbent
that the problems should be solved, but provision for solutions ought to be started. What are some of the problems?
[ Translation]
Unemployment: one out of every eight Canadians has been without a job for the past two years. Among our young people, 18 per cent are unemployed. Poverty: 4.3 million Canadians are now living below the poverty line. Moreover, most of our single-parent families whose head is a woman are also living below the poverty line.
The tax system: it has become increasingly unfair. Over the past 10 years, the number of Canadians whose income exceeds $50,000 per year and who are paying absolutely no income tax has increased from 300 to over 8,000.

Add to these particular problems, that are very real, the problems of our farmers. During the past decade, year in and year out, farmers have had a decline in their real income. Add to that the problems which are becoming increasingly evident for men, and particularly women, who are faced with technological change. One can see that any government coming to power in Canada at this particular moment, whatever its ideological stripe, has its problems set out.
Canadians voted for change. I sincerely congratulate the Prime Minister and his Party. They won one of the great political victories in the history of our country and they deserve to be commended for getting the democratic support of the majority of our people. Having received that support, and having obtained a mandate for change, leadership of a very high order is required, leadership which will indeed begin to address the problems and do so from within the framework of the changes which were promised in the election campaign. The people of Canada are looking for change which will be compassionate, serious and which will provide a greater opportunity for Canadians, young and old, men and women.
If we begin to assess the Throne Speech-and I think in this debate we should spend a little time on that-and if we look at the speech in terms of providing change, what do we find? First, we must consider the stated goals and look at what is found in this Throne Speech as compared with previous Throne Speeches provided by the Liberal Government.
In this speech we find a commitment to ""national reconciliation"". That is a replacement for the Liberal wording which covered the same objective. The Liberals preferred to offer a ""new era of federal-provincial consultation"".
On the subject of social justice, we heard a commitment to ""value and support the comprehensive social security system"", instead of the Liberal words of ""strengthening the safety net"". Perhaps that expression is a little less elegant, but it is the same goal.
On the question of economic renewal, instead of Liberal talk about a ""critical national objective"", the Conservatives give us a ""critical national challenge"". Having listened to the Throne Speech, I was not at all surprised to hear on the news that evening the finance critic for the Liberal Party saying that the
Conservative Throne Speech could have been written by a Liberal. I would make a small correction to that statement-it was written by a Liberal.
If there is nothing new in terms of the stated objectives of this Government, if it is essentially a reformulation using new buzz words and new concepts of goals which were provided by the previous Liberal government, I would say right away that the New Democratic Party supports the same goals. I would also say that when the day comes-and I believe it will come-that the New Democratic Party will write a Throne Speech for the people of Canada, and if we talk about the same laudable goals, we will use new terminology. My concern is not with the spurious battle of words. I would rather get on with what I regard to be the essence of such a debate and the essence of such a Throne Speech. It is not over that type of matter that I feel we should be having disputes. My concerns are a little different.
My concern is not about the general goals, which I have said are quite laudable; my concerns are with specifics. The specifics, such as they were in the Throne Speech, almost without exception, were the unfulfilled specifics of the old Liberal agenda. I will not document that case. However, I believe any journalist-and there are a number of journalists who actually do their homework-looking through the list of specific Throne Speech commitments provided by the new so-called Conservative Government would find very quickly that the specific commitments which relate to some of these goals are, by and large, on the unfulfilled agenda of the past Parliament.
I want to add right away, Mr. Speaker, that many of those particular specific commitments we would support as well. However, I raise this point for the consideration of the people of Canada, those men and women who are regarding this debate as it takes place in the House of Commons, those men and women in Atlantic Canada-

-in the fine province of Quebec, in the province of Ontario and in Western Canada who have voted for a change.

I have a simple question: where is the change? Where is the change, Mr. Speaker? Where is the new beginning we were promised?
With respect to the Throne Speech, what really does concern me is not simply the absence of the specifics, and I will come back to some of those in a moment, but what is the economic philosophy which permeates the Throne Speech. The political agenda of this Government began to be set out pretty clearly shortly after September 4 in statements made by the Prime Minister from Meech Lake, by statements made by the Minister of National Revenue (Mr. Beatty), the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), and other Ministers of the Crown. It is perhaps best illustrated by a phrase from the Throne Speech
November 7, 1984

itself-which I understand was added at the last moment- which is this:
That we must deal urgently with the deficit is beyond dispute.
This is not simply the view, Mr. Speaker, expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Turner), at least the view he expressed before the summer campaign got under way. It is also the view which had begun to be established by the previous Liberal Government. The Liberal Throne Speech of last year used the following words: the Government would pursue-
-a fiscal policy track which will contain and then curb the federal deficit as recovery strengthens.
The case I want to make, Mr. Speaker-and I do so for all members of my Party from coast to coast as well as for all the men and women of our country-that if they considered all the implications of this debate, they would find that this fundamental approach pursued by the previous Liberal Government in its latter years, and reiterated with great emphasis by this new Conservative Government, is fundamentally wrong. This approach by the Government mistakes the symptoms for the disease. By attacking on a priority basis the symptoms of a disease instead of its causes, there is serious risk of doing irreparable damage to the patient.
I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that our problem is one of bad economic performance. Our problem in Canada is that too many men and women are collecting unemployment insurance cheques instead of paycheques. Our problem is that there is too much suffering and too few jobs in the country. Our need as a nation is not to repeat the errors of the past but to learn from them. Our need is not to have a government which plans to implement recent Liberal policy. What we need is a government which would change that Liberal policy.
I say with a great deal of emphasis, Mr. Speaker, that the current mess our economy is in and its ramifications throughout our land were indeed the creation of the Liberal Party of Canada. There can be no doubt about that. However, I also want to say that the Liberal Government just a few years ago began to try to extricate itself from this mess. It began then to see as a disease what I have described as the symptoms. It began to go just a few years ago in a direction which the Conservative Party has now pursued and will be pursuing with a great deal of vigour, I am sure, tomorrow night. That is to say, it began a series of policies and programs with which Canadians are now pretty familiar. I want to remind the Conservatives of the Liberal origin of their current policy. We had in recent years the six and five program, civil service cut-backs, reductions in family allowances, reductions in pensions, and increased loopholes provided in our tax system for upper-income Canadians. We had not millions but billions of dollars in the form of give-aways in an unaccountable fashion introduced into the corporate tax system, give-aways which went out to the corporate sector without performance criteria being attached to them. All of these things, I say, are within the framework of the kind of policy which is now being pursued but incorrectly described by this new Government as being a new policy. These policies were begun by the Liberals.
The Address-Mr. Broadbent
What did the Liberals say that these policies would lead to? They said that they would lead to economic recovery, that they would begin to turn the mess around which the Liberals had created from 1968 up to the end of the 1970s. But what did we receive instead? We had upper-income Canadians who received the tax breaks, yes, but last year investment in the economy went down, not up. We had thousands of corporations taking advantage of the tax benefits, and I do not criticize them for doing so. Anyone would take a tax benefit if he could. However, the same corporations, according to the president of one of our chartered banks, indicated there was a whole batch of programs which gave them windfall profits they did not need. They received largesse from the taxpayers but did not invest it. We did not create more jobs, Mr. Speaker, we created fewer jobs, and it is to these kinds of programs that we want to put an end.
I want to say to the Conservative Government that, in my view, the approach that it is now embarking upon could turn out to be not only disastrous for the people of Canada but could be its own political undoing. Partisan politics is something that that Party understands very well. I ask the Conservative Government to consider those parts of the world that have already put into operation, on a deeply penetrating basis, the kind of approach which the Liberals started in recent years and which we heard in the Throne Speech and in statements earlier this month from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. It has not been applied in the United States. Mr. Reagan was originally elected on a campaign to reduce the deficit. He went around the United States saying that the top priority should be the reduction of the deficit. When Mr. Reagan came to power, what did he do? Did he reduce the deficit? Not at all. The United States under the Reagan administration has had the most massive increase in the deficit of any period since World War II. The United States has also had the most rapid economic growth, the lowest level of inflation and the best job-creation rate of any industrialized country in recent years. Mr. Reagan preached one thing but practised another when it came to major fiscal policy.
Where have we seen the application of this new Conservative approach, Mr. Speaker? Where have we seen it put into operation? We have seen it put into operation in the United Kingdom by Margaret Thatcher, who made the mistake of not only taking up the rhetoric of Mr. Reagan but the substance. What she has produced in the United Kingdom is an unmitigated disaster. High unemployment persists, social conflict has exacerbated. Instead of bringing a sense of renewal of purpose to the people of Great Britain, Mrs. Thatcher has brought to them a new level of despondency.
I do not have to go to the United Kingdom either, Mr. Speaker. I can go right to the West Coast and the Social Credit Government of Mr. Bennett. We have seen in the Province of British Columbia that Conservative philosophy which the present Prime Minister has advocated in this Throne Speech. That province, once wealthy in opportunities for men and women, in jobs and social services, has gone persistently

November 7, 1984
The Address-Mr. Broadbent
downhill ever since Mr. Bennett applied the economic philosophy of the so-called new Conservative Government we have with us today. Not only has unemployment worsened but, I say with care and concern, so have relationships among the people of British Columbia. We have never seen such conflict and antagonism within the same community as we now find in British Columbia. Anyone would be pretty naive and foolish to think the people of British Columbia are fundamentally different from Canadians elsewhere. Not at all. When you have a misapplication of an economic philosophy, when you have a government that wants to determine its policies to benefit the quick and the slick, a government that tries to turn recent economic history upside down by putting forward the wrong set of priorities, you create the kind of disharmony and tension that we have in British Columbia. My Party will have nothing to do with that for the country as a whole.
There was a time, Mr. Speaker, when the Prime Minister himself, it seemed to me, in the election campaign had a view very similar to what I am expressing. One of the speeches he made in the summer of 1984 seemed to indicate, in my view, that he had a proper sense of economic priorities for this nation. He said in Vancouver on August 24, appropriately enough in light of what I have just said, that ""clearly there can be no drastic reduction in the deficit until interest rates are lower and the country gets back to work. Massive cuts now would guarantee a recession"". Well, I say to you, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister was right when he said that in the summer of 1984, and he should be applying consistently the same thought as a matter of policy in November, 1984, in the House of Commons.
I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that there are very specific things that could be done to implement the general goals which were outlined in the Throne Speech, and with which I happen to agree, where it talked about economic renewal, co-operation and social justice. I also want to suggest that there are proposals the Prime Minister himself made during the election campaign but which we now find notably absent from what he plans to do as Prime Minister.
Let us consider first of all economic renewal. I believe it to be the case that we really want to reduce the deficit at some point. Every sensible politician, every sensible Canadian, indeed every sensible person around the world, wants at some point to have a reduction in his deficit. You would have to be pretty mindless to say, no, we must go on forever with increasing deficits. That is a spurious caricature of the position some people take. No one really takes that position. But if you begin with your priority of economic growth, which is what we begin with, then when you get that, you will have revenue because people have jobs. The Government will receive taxes from both individuals and companies because the people are working and the companies are making profits instead of suffering losses.
Therefore, the priorities should be jobs, jobs, jobs, as the Prime Minister once said. We should be setting targets for unemployment reduction. It seems to me that, as certain other nations have done in recent times, you could set a target of a 2 per cent to 3 per cent reduction per year in unemployment.
Why in God's name, when we have 1.5 million Canadians suffering unemployment, do we have to wait, as this Throne Speech says, until next spring? Why can we not set those targets now to give Canadians some help?

Well, as the Prime Minister promised at one point in the campaign, we could have a reduction in interest rates. We have suggested, and I will not go over the details now, a process which, as a matter of fact, certain Conservative circles endorsed, as I found in a learned Journal not long ago, as one approach to interest rate reduction. I will commend the article to the Prime Minister. He could bring down interest rates, and that would make it easier for business to borrow and expand. But I say, not only to the Prime Minister but to the Leader of the Opposition, that if we have a 1 per cent or 2 per cent reduction in interest rates, the carrying charges for our very substantial national debt would be reduced by millions of dollars each year. In addition, we should do something which seems to me should hardly be seen as radical in a modern world. Instead of having a corporate tax policy that simply gives out money to corporations in the rather naive hope, whatever the market circumstances may be, that they will reinvest the money and use it for productive purposes, we should put an end to this largesse. We should say to corporations: Yes, if you perform, if you have a retraining program and affirmative action programs for women, if you expand because you have purchased equipment from another Canadian firm, then yes, then and only then you will get money from the Canadian taxpayer. That is the kind of policy we think should be put in place.

Mr. Speaker, we must establish a youth initiative assistance program, such as the one which was part of our party platform last summer, to help young people, put to good use both their knowledge and skills. Such a program would encourage economic initiatives and create 100,000 new jobs for our young men and women. It would result in major economic spin-offs. [English]
Next, Mr. Speaker, in terms of economic renewal, we could have some resource upgrading. Surely the time is long overdue in this resource-rich land of ours that we took seriously the task of upgrading into finished form more of the products of our forests, mines and fishery instead of simply dealing, as we have for so long in our history, with the export of the raw product. It is time now to upgrade our resources and get more of those secondary jobs. New investment is required there.
The income of farmers has been going down for a decade. The Conservatives could implement what they promised, which is to remove the tax on fuels for our farmers so that they could do their job more efficiently. Consumers would benefit and so would they as producers.
These proposals, Mr. Speaker, would put the priorities right. We are not wed to all of these ideas, but some of them make

excellent economic sense. All of them we would like to see implemented, but 1 plead with the Government, if it is talking about economic renewal, to forget this recently acquired version of Reaganism. Look at what has happened in the United Kingdom and in British Columbia. Let it implement instead the priorities that the Prime Minister promised to the people of Canada in August when he sought the office of Prime Minister.
If I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to move from the question of economic renewal to that of co-operation. The Prime Minister has spoken often about that, and I believe that he believes it very genuinely. I say candidly that one of the pleasant aspects of the personality of the Prime Minister is that he does have a disposition to try to make friends instead of making enemies, and that is good in any nation. It is particularly good in a federal state like Canada. I also say that he is going to discover before long, whether in dealing with the Premiers or with President Reagan, that a warm handshake and a smile are not sufficient. If we want a co-operative attitude to develop in our country, it seems to me that certain basic policies, rather than just attitudes, must be implemented.
Consider taxation. We in my Party talked a lot in the summer campaign about taxation from the point of view of justice and fairness. It is wrong that a pensioner and a working man and woman in this land should be paying plenty of taxes when a rich person does not have to pay a cent. Certainly from the point of view of justice we should have a change which ensures that everyone pays his or her share.
I also want to recast the argument, Mr. Speaker, because it is not simply from the point of view of justice that my Party speaks about the need for tax reform. We believe in co-operation too. We believe that men and women working in the private and public sectors should have a more co-operative attitude toward one another. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I ask the Prime Minister whether he would not have a much greater chance of obtaining that from working people, like IWA members, steelworkers or the many men and women in our country who are not in trade unions at all, if he said that there is going to be tax reform so that upper income Canadians will have to pay their share. Otherwise, other Canadians may ask, ""Why should we co-operate? Why should we not get all we can out of the market system? Why should we have a built-in obligation to try to achieve community if those who are most able to pay are not paying a cent?"" Therefore, I say to the Prime Minister that it is not simply for justice but also to develop a sense of co-operation that tax fairness is important.
I come to the issue of social justice, which was also addressed in the Throne Speech. Instead of merely giving us an agenda of the unfulfilled commitments of the previous Liberal Government, some of whose items are quite good and some of whose items men and women in all Parties of the House agree with, why did the Government not bring forward something that was really new in the justice field?
The Address-Mr. Broadbent
With regard to pensions, they are setting up a new consultative process. It makes sense to consult with the provinces about a lot of things. We have had commissions, we have had study groups, and we have had parliamentary groups. It seems to me that in the past decade we have had half the country studying pension reform. Could the Government not have said that it will begin now with some legislation to initiate pension reform?
On the subject of daycare, everyone in the country knows that the majority of women growing up now are going to be working outside the home. There has been a decisive turning point, not only in the history of Canada, but in the history of all developed societies. Some women will indeed work, get their satisfaction and make their contribution in the home, but the majority of women growing up are going to work outside the home. Anyone who has studied this problem knows very well, from either the male or female perspective, that if we are concerned about the development of children, something must be done quickly about daycare facilities. Why do we have to set up a committee of the House, as is proposed in the Throne Speech, to look into the idea of daycare? Would it not have made more sense to set up the committee on the basis that the principle of daycare is now assumed, that we are going to have it in Canada, and have that committee report back, perhaps in three months, about the methods of raising revenue in our federal system to make it a real possibility? At the same time we should introduce a minimum tax on all those who are earning more than $50,000 a year, something which we have proposed. From that tax alone more than $400 million in additional revenue would be raised. That money is more than adequate for the initial downpayment which has been advocated by the Canadian Daycare Advocacy Association to give a start to daycare. That is what we could do with it.
I now turn to another area of social justice, that is, the equality principle for women. Surely, Mr. Speaker, if there was an aspect of the campaign which we all lived through in the summer of 1984 which was not simply symbolic but a change of fundamental importance to the history of our land, it was the presence of women in the campaign. They were not all necessarily candidates. My Party had a lot of women, but I say frankly that we did not have a sufficient number of them in terms of what we would like in the future. I am not talking simply about the level of candidate participation. I am talking about women in our society, whether in Montreal, British Columbia, Ontario or on the Prairies. Let us put the issue of the equality of women on the political agenda of our country where it belongs.
As I read the Throne Speech, Mr. Speaker, and I read it with care, I was more than disturbed, I was deeply disappointed, because in reading that wording I found that when one got beyond the rhetoric to a consideration of the specifics, there was in fact a regression in the commitment made to women. There was a move backwards rather than forwards. I want to remind the Prime Minister of what he said in the election on the issue of fundamental importance to us, the issue of equality

between the sexes. He said this with reference to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value:
Of course, I will go further. I will make sure that this equality principle is adhered to by all those who are eager to do business with the federal government.

He said that on August 15 during the NAC debate in the election campaign. That was an unequivocal commitment to ensure that companies doing business with the Government of Canada would need to have in operation the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.
On the other important issue affecting Canadian women, that of affirmative action, in March of last year the Prime Minister said the following, which was repeated significantly in May at the lunches with leaders in Toronto:
When seeking Government business, companies will be required to detail their action plans, timetables and programs for attracting, training and advancing women within their operations. This, in my view, is a legitimate and fair requirement.
I say through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Prime Minister that if it was appropriate to make commitments in the summer about the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, if it was appropriate to insist on behalf of Canadian women that private companies produce affirmative action programs during an election campaign, it ought to have been in the Throne Speech which we had this week.

There are things which can be done and there are things which should be done.
It is clear, in my view, that the Liberal Party does not really know what it wants. It said one thing in July, another thing in August, and another thing in the House of Commons. However, something is clear, and that is, that we in the New Democratic Party will maintain consistent with what we promised. When a laid-off worker in the Yukon calls, we will be listening. When a woman telephone worker in Newfoundland complains about sexual discrimination, we will be with her. The next time a farmer in Saskatchewan must take action to defend his or her family farm against a bank, we will be one their side. In short, in the summer of 1984 the New Democratic Party campaigned day in and day out for the ordinary person of this country, and I pledge that the same Party will work day in and day out in the House of Commons for the same people. Thank you very much.
