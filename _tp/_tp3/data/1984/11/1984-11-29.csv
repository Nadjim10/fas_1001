I would first like to commend the Minister for introducing this Bill which will enable us to borrow the most necessary funds to keep the country going. The Government must borrow to meet its financial requirements. We have produced the facts that are necessary for speedy consideration of this Bill.
In his economic statement the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) advised Canadians that adjustments, cuts and new initiatives were needed to support and encourage economic recovery, to create jobs, and to give Canadians the confidence and stability to invest in this great country in order that it will move forward. The Government promised to take control and it is doing just that. The economic situation which we inherited after years of Liberal mismanagement calls for some tough specific actions, but they will be sound. Running the country is exactly like running any business. We all know that when expenses are greater than revenues a deficit is created. The Government was elected to deal with the challenges facing the country and the deficit is one of our greatest challenges.
Canadians have given the Government a strong mandate to embark on the long, complex and painful task of building a lasting economic consensus for our nation. I believe Canadians know that the Government is approaching, and will continue to approach, Canada's problems. Paying the bills is one of our problems. The Government is moving with compassion, commitment and fairness.
To put our own fiscal house in order and to reverse the massive buildup of public debt, we must and will meet our commitments. Many of these commitments were made by the previous government. We are going to honour our commitments. We are honest, sincere and open. The people of Canada want, and shall receive, fair treatment, Mr. Speaker. They voted for a Government that will get the country back on its feet. Through extensive consultation and communication with the provinces, business people, labour and all Canadians, the Government will make fair decisions for all regions of Canada. We will no longer see confrontation and unilateral decisions, for the Government has a responsibility. It is facing reality. We can no longer meet every need. We simply cannot do it all.
My home is Calgary, Mr. Speaker. Calgary was absolutely brought to its knees by the financial mismanagement of this country and the destruction of the oil and gas industry in 1980. The Liberal National Energy Program was a disaster. The previous Government singled out a number one industry and then raped it. Half of the drilling rigs in western Canada have been idled or they have left the country. People left for a more secure and favourable climate. Those who were left behind went belly-up. The only way to make a buck in the drilling industry is to keep that iron turning.
I invite Hon. Members here today to come out west to the producing provinces. Come out and see the rigs. Come on the floor. See the pipe which is made from the steel from Ontario and the wire cable that is made in Mississauga and the Arctic clothing that comes from Quebec. The survival suits in the Beaufort are made in Vancouver.
As one can see, when the resource industry was so hard halted thousands of jobs were lost all across Canada. The previous Government's energy policy is directly responsible for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, billions of investment dollars leaving this country and four wasted years in achieving self-sufficiency for Canada.
A PGRT was applied to gross revenues. That is a petroleum and gas revenue tax, where there were no deductions for spending on new exploration and development and no deductions for royalties paid to the provinces. The previous government then revised the corporate income tax. The old earned depletion deduction was eliminated. It then imposed a natural gas and gas liquids tax. It went on and on. In its greed, the Liberal Government heavily taxed this industry. It based its theory on high world oil prices and increased consumption. However, someone forgot to tell that government that one does not budget on anticipation but on hard facts and figures.
We in the oil and gas business need a tremendous lead time to produce. We need 8 to 12 years for geological surveys, for land acquisition and exploration. We need this in order to get development and production. This industry has to find its raw materials first before it can manufacture the product. These

are unique circumstances. The up-front capital is high risk and should be treated as a high-risk investment.
I correspond with some 250 members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and small businessmen in my riding on a regular basis. They are desperate to keep their businesses going, let alone expand their capabilities. This means jobs and we cannot foster tomorrow's increased employment until we meet yesterday's obligations.
This is what Bill C-ll is all about. If my hon. friend, the Member for Hamilton East (Ms. Copps), was in the House today, I would ask her to turn back a few pages in history to see what her government did to strangle the resource industry. When that industry turned down, we quit making hole and when we quit making hole we did not need pipe. If we did not need pipe, then we did not need steel from Hamilton. We did not need draw works and we did not need wire cable. In fact, we did not need anything. The unemployment in her riding is directly related to her government.
This Government is committed to giving Canadians a well managed, efficient and productive Government. We promised a major overhaul of planning and budgetary controls and we will produce. There are no easy solutions. Our mandate is huge but we will keep our promises. I want to tell my hon. friends how proud I am to be a member of the House and to have this opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-l 1 today.

I am sure that the Hon. Member and the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) recall this statement being made. Could she tell us of the Government's progress in keeping this promise?

In this book that I have in my hand entitled ""Expenditure Review"", the Government has cut thousands of jobs from my riding right here in the Ottawa area as well as in the ridings of several Hon.

Since September 17 of this year, we have created 34,000 jobs in this country. 1 can assure my hon. colleague from Calgary South that she was right when she said we have already created a climate favourable to employment. In my riding, where factories were in great trouble as a result of neglect on the part of the previous administration, thanks to the initiative and imaginative approach of Gatineau workers, we are now reopening factories that had been closed down.
The Hon. Member is correct in saying that out West they are drilling oil wells with Ontario steel and the talents and human resources of Quebec and Gatineau, because 1 know that, as far as my riding is concerned, we have people who are working out West. Many lost their jobs over the last three years, that is true, but fortunately, a number of people are still working in Western Canada.
1 know that thanks to efforts of our Government and the negotiating and conciliatory skills of our Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Mrs. Carney), there will very soon be a considerable activity in the West. Canadian oil will be produced by Canadians, consumed by Canadians and used to help develop Canada's resources, and this will be done by Canadian companies, not like what happened in the past, when jobs were exported because they were buying out foreign companies and sending billions of dollars to Belgium and buying oil from other countries because the administration here in Canada did not have the political or moral courage to face up to its responsibilities.

The challenge has been made that this Government has not acted on anything. What a facile challenge; what a simple one to respond to! 1 recall the Liberal Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board delaying for two months making payments to the wheat stabilization board, simply because he did not know where he was supposed to sign the cheque. We did that immediately. We froze Seaway tolls immediately. We froze the abandonment of rail lines, which guarantees and ensures that farmers in western Canada have an opportunity to get their wheat on rail. We froze the rail abandonment in my constituency, which is in the forest sector, to ensure that the mills could get their lumber to overseas markets. Those were the kinds of initiatives which were taken immediately. Also we took a very interesting initiative about which I am very happy. It was the initiative to relieve members of the Liberal Party of their seats in the House of Commons.
It is true that the Hon. Member for Calgary South did not have an opportunity to make that suggestion to the Hon. Member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell (Mr. Boudria). Nevertheless, contingent upon that defeat of these people who had not been serving Canadians the way they wanted to be served was a number of employment opportunities which the Liberals themselves had created. Those opportunities without direct address to the intelligence, the capability and the area of endeavour of individuals have now been terminated. I think that is most appropriate.

It is interesting to see that now the members of the Liberal Party are opposing what the Government is doing, saying it is not parliamentary, it is not right. They are correct. Their objection is valid. However, how soon they have forgotten that only a few years ago they were doing exactly the same when they were in government. The word hypocrisy is a mild word to describe this behaviour. How soon our friends across the way have also forgotten.
I was somewhat disappointed in the speech last night of the Hon. Member for Mississauga South (Mr. Blenkarn). He was one of the most capable critics of the Government and of government borrowing Bills in this House. He was a man of integrity who thought out his arguments well and presented them forcefully. Members like the Hon. Member for Mississauga South and other Opposition members in both the Conservative Party and New Democratic Party succeeded in forcing the previous government to break down its borrowing authority Bill.
Let me warn the Minister and the Government that the very same tactics that the Conservative Party used in 1982 can be used again today against them. The business of this House can be brought to a standstill by the Opposition if the Government insists on breaking the rules and traditions of this House. The page that we will borrow is the page that the Conservative Party wrote in 1982. Let this Government be warned that we will not forget their opposition in the past. We will certainly raise that opposition if it continues to operate in the same manner that the Liberal government of the day acted.
It is somewhat distressing to hear the speeches of Hon. Members of this House, particularly Government members. Their depth of understanding of economic and government issues is very shallow. As I hear their remarks, I am reminded of religious cults like the Moonies. All I hear are simplistic phrases being bandied about, not just by back-benchers but by Ministers as well. They are simply solutions, as far as Government members' are concerned, to the problems facing the economy of Canada and the western world today.
The big bogyman is government-too much government spending which resulted in tremendous deficits, which in turn has yanked up interest rates. This has resulted in a downturn of economic activities. The solution is to bring down the deficit by slashing government spending; down go the interest rates, up goes growth, up goes job creation and hurrah, happy days are here again!

Members applaud again. Let me educate them a bit. Let me suggest to them that in my home province, the Province of Saskatchewan, the Government has had a balance budget for years and years. When the so-called socialist horde composed of irresponsible spenders and freewheelers inherited the province in 1944, it was a province that was broke, that was in debt, that did not have an electrical system or a roads system. It had a population that was scattered over many, many miles. We were able to electrify that province and build a roads system second to none without incurring tremendous debts. When we were defeated in 1982, the budget of the Government of Saskatchewan had a surplus while the budgets of the Government of Alberta, the Government of B.C. and the Government of Ontario had deficits. Those were well-to-do provinces controlled by Tories.
Let us now take a look at Saskatchewan today. After two years of Tory rule, after two years of cut-backs in social programs, after two years of selling off provincial assets like Crown corporations and highway equipment, Saskatchewan has the highest accumulated deficit in the history of the province. All of the past deficits rolled into one cannot meet what has been done by the Tories in only two years.
Hon. Members are not applauding any longer. Is it a shock for Tories to realize that Tory governments have produced the largest deficit in the history of England, the United States and Saskatchewan? Surely that does not quite make sense in light of the rhetoric we have been hearing here. What is going on? Tories who are philosophically committed to balancing the budget end up in the end with record deficits by using Tory

programs. What is going on here? What is the explanation for this?

The unemployment rate in Saskatchewan has increased since the Tories were elected. So much for business confidence in the Province of Saskatchewan.
Let us have a look at the situation, Mr. Speaker. Why do Tory times produce massive deficits? They produce massive deficits because they are committed to a philosophy and theory of economics that has been shown not to work. It is the monetarist theory developed by the Chicago School of Economics and Dr. Friedman. I will explain it in a plain and simple way which I think Hon. Members, particularly the Hon. Member for Bow River (Mr. Taylor), will understand. The philosophy is that if one feeds a horse a great deal of oats, the sparrow will eventually get some. That is essentially the monetarist philosophy. They believe in giving the corporate sector a great many tax breaks. I say this tongue in cheek to the Hon. Member for Bow River because I know that he is a prairie populist who has as much distrust of the CPR as I have, but they believe in giving tax breaks to the CPR. The essential notion is that if the corporate sector is given a lot of tax breaks, eventually those breaks will filter through the economy and create jobs and prosperity for all. That is a nice simplistic solution except that it does not work. Because the solution does not work, we have a downturn in economic activity. The Government forgoes tremendous revenues. We see this over and over again.
As the critic of the Revenue Department, I have been following the actions of the Minister of National Revenue (Mr. Beatty) with some interest. This is an example of the philosophy at work. In The Globe and Mail of November 28, there appeared an article with the headline: ""Ottawa makes it easier for business to avoid tax"". It is indicated in that article that the Minister has announced that his Department will help the private sector find tax loopholes in order to determine if setting up a dummy company is legal or not. The third paragraph of the article to which I have referred reads:
An advance ruling would allow a company that is considering, for instance, establishment of a dummy corporation that would reduce its tax bill, to find out whether its proposed strategy is legal.
The Minister went on to say that he thought that business people were spending too much time looking for tax loopholes. He felt they should be spending their time making money and doing normal business things rather than looking for tax
Borrowing Authority
loopholes. Therefore, the Government, at the expense of the people, will find these tax loopholes for them. Is that not sweet of the Government? How much are we going to lose on this? When is the Government going to realize that, in order to reduce the deficit, it should stop looking at the expenditure side and start looking at the revenue side?
Just yesterday we heard from the Economic Council of Canada which stated in its report that the problem with the deficit is not over-expenditure but lack of revenue. A newspaper article of November 28, 1984, reads as follows:
The federal deficit, expected to reach $34.6 billion this year, has not been growing because spending is out of control, the council said. Rather, the Government has failed to keep raising enough taxes to cover its expenditures.
Tax exemptions and loopholes combined with slow economic growth during the past 10 years have cost Ottawa almost $100 billion in tax revenues.
Is the Government concerned with the revenue side? Is the Government concerned with doing those things that create economic activity and therefore tax revenues? Is the Government concerned with doing those things that would stop some of the tax loopholes? No, Mr. Speaker, because in its simplistic solution it is the expenditure side that is the cause of our deficit. As far as the Government is concerned, spending is out of control. Again, simplistic solutions to complex problems will lead to further disaster in Canada today.
It is unfortunate that the Hon. Member for Mississauga South is not present today. I attempted to ask him some questions yesterday when we asked the House to give unanimous consent to allow the Hon. Member more time for an exchange after his speech. I understand that every Member of the House was willing to give him more time except a member of the Conservative Party. I found that a bit strange.
The Hon. Member for Mississauga South spent a fair amount of his time explaining how some provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act allow some of his constituents, who worked many hours during the summer and who were involved in the construction business, to be eligible for UI payments and they take advantage of those payments during the winter construction slowdown, even though they are really not in need. However, legally, they are eligible for those benefits. The Hon. Member felt that that was wrong and that the requirements should be tightened. In a scheme such as unemployment insurance there are many different situations. There may be cases of people receiving benefits which perhaps they should not be receiving. In some cases it may be legal, in other cases it may not be legal. The Hon. Member for Mississauga South was very concerned about that. I accept the concern of the Hon. Member, but we should maintain a sense of proportion.
Was the Hon. Member concerned about the tax loopholes which are being provided through the research and development tax credit? He called it a scam, and I certainly agree with him. It was introduced in the Budget which was brought down by Mr. Lalonde. It was only supposed to cost the public treasury $100 million. Now the estimate is that it has cost over $1.5 billion and this scam will cost another $400 million or

November 29, 1984
Borrowing Authority
S500 million. It will produce very few actual research and development dollars. For example, I understand that Imperial Oil bought $500 million worth of the credits and has paid itself a fee for doing the paper transactions of $25 million. I wonder what type of research and development will result.
I congratulate the Government. When it was elected it realized that this was a scam and set about trying to correct it. It corrected it! It imposed a moratorium. However, now we realize that the moratorium had a flaw. It had an escape hatch which is called a grandfather clause. The Minister of National Revenue admitted that under the provisions of the grandfather clause all sorts of new deals are being introduced and that it will cost the public treasury another $400 million or $500 million. When I brought this to the attention of the Hon. Member for Mississauga South he told me to wait a minute, that it could not simply be cut off overnight. Agreements were made. He said that we should not have to tell business folks that this provision was part of the law and that it would be cut off overnight. The Hon. Member was quite concerned about the propriety of cutting off the grandfather provision of the R and D tax credit scheme. It is too bad that he did not have the same concern about cutting off UI benefits to those people who are eligible for them and who are planning their retirement with those benefits in mind. Those people know that his Government will cut out the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act. When the Unemployment Insurance Act is changed, there will be no grandfather clause. Those changes will be overnight. There will be no provision for those people who are earning $15,000 or $20,000 a year. But for Imperial Oil there are a lot of grandfather clauses.
That is the difference between that political party and the NDP. That party is concerned with the Imperial Oils of the world. Our concern is with the person who is retiring and who has an income of $25,000, $30,000 or $40,000 a year. That is the difference, and because of that I oppose this borrowing authority Bill.

Member for Regina East (Mr. de Jong) said in his remarks that he was going to educate the Hon. Members of this House, in particular Members on this side, about certain things having to do with the economic policy of the Government. In his remarks he talked about simplicity and lamented the fact that the Government had outlined in a simple and straightforward manner the formula for economic renewal. While he eschews the notion of simplicity, he went on to compare the economic thinking of the Government to the Moonies. Talk about over-simplistic analysis!
In his remarks he also used the word ""hypocrisy"". Yet he denounced the large size of government deficits and went on to speak critically of a government which has come into office inheriting a record-high deficit and a spending level which is increasing. The Government is taking definite, specific and immediate steps to bring the situation under control. I think the word ""hypocrisy"" is not appropriate.
He also asked when the Government would begin looking at the revenue side and not only deal with cuts in expenditures. If the Hon. Member is asking when the Government will deal with that, his ""education"" of Members on this side leaves a great deal to be desired. Where was the Hon. Member when the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) said that he would close the tax loopholes which involved the research and development tax credit? He lamented that nothing was being done to deal with loopholes. He spoke of the revenue side and the fact there were benefits for some. Where was he when it was announced that there would indeed be a minimum tax on the rich? Where was he when the Minister of National Revenue (Mr. Beatty) outlined a series of fair and proper measures to ensure that tax revenues owing to the federal Government would be collected? That is concrete and precise action on the revenue side. People who have been avoiding tax will be dealt with in an effective manner, not on the basis of the quota system which was tried by the previous Liberal government.
Where was he when the Minister of Finance, outlined in his economic statement that the way to economic recovery the way to generate funds on the revenue side and the way to get the deficit down is through letting the private sector return to doing what it does best: creating jobs, generating wealth and continuing to be involved in genuine economic activity?
I would say to the Hon. Member for Regina East that if he intends to educate Hon. Members, he should first do his homework.

The Tories opposed that in opposition. They said: ""What do you mean, borrow $2 billion in case of emergency?"" Those were the speeches I listened to from the Hon. Member for Mississauga South.

The Hon. Member mentioned the minimum tax. 1 congratulate the Government for acting on this provision. We will have to see what type of minimum tax is introduced, whether it is smoke and mirrors or whether it will be a meaningful tax which will make the system a little bit fairer. That we will have to see.
The Hon. Member talks about tax collection. The Government pointed out in the economic statement that it was going to try and collect some $400 million in taxes that no one disputes are owed to it. In fact, there are some $4.5 billion in uncollected taxes which are beyond dispute. There are almost $400 million which the corporate sector has collected from its employees which they have not transmitted to the Government even though they are legally required to do so at the end of each month. For the Government to enforce just that one provision would bring in almost $400 million, never mind the $1.6 billion the corporate sector owes but has not yet paid.
The Hon. Member ended his remarks by saying that the Government is committed to letting the private sector do its thing and if we could only do that, prosperity is here. I suggest to him that the economic history of this country and its development is one where the private and public sectors have worked together. There is a tremendous role for the public sector to play, and for this Government to destroy that part of the public sector will be disastrous to this country and the private sector as well.

We did not have to do much proselytizing to make people understand the deficit had been running out of control and something responsible had to be done about it. The Hon.

If one looks at a comparable period in Alberta, in prosperous times that province was able to build up a very handsome surplus; but Saskatchewan had a balanced budget. However, when the new government had a chance to look at the books it realized that, through some very creative bookkeeping involving Crown corporations and government departments, a true accounting of

However, the facts are still very simple and clear: Saskatchewan today has a deficit higher than it has ever been in the history of the province. That deficit has been incurred since the Conservatives have been elected in Saskatchewan. For the Hon. Member to say that they did not have a look at the books gives me a feeling of dej'a vu. I do not think the people of Saskatchewan buy that and I do not think the people of Canada are going to buy it either. The people of Canada voted overwhelmingly to put the Conservatives into office because they were tired of the Liberals, not because of any of their programs or policies.Those programs and policies did not exist.

William Rompkey (Grand Falls-White Bay-Labrador):,,GOVERNMENT ORDERS,"BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1984-85 (No. 2) MEASURE TO ENACT",,"Mr. Speaker, as the Hon. Member for Trinity (Miss Nicholson) said yesterday, the difficulty we have with this Bill is not so much in and of the Bill itself but that it has come to us all at once. It is hard to assimilate and it takes time to find out exactly what is happening and what the impact of the Throne Speech, the economic statement and now this borrowing Bill is going to be.
We on this side want to take the time to examine it and do two other things. First of all we want to make sure that our people know exactly what government policy is. Then, as their representatives in this House, we want to stand up and say what they would say if they were here. We are their representatives and our job is to say what they would say if they could be here. I want to try and tell the House and you, Mr. COMMONS DEBATES
November 29, 1984
Borrowing Authority
Speaker, as well as the Government, what my people would say if they were here. I said some of it yesterday in reply to the Hon. Member for Mississauga South (Mr. Blenkarn) who made the same point that the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) made in his speech. That is, that one of the reasons unemployment insurance has to be cut, among other programs, is that there are people in Canada who really are not trying hard enough to get jobs. There are 176,000 jobs, we are told, going begging in this country and now we have the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald) hiring 700 people to go around the country and oversee the people who are unemployed. That is 700 new jobs, but what it will do for the unemployed remains to be seen. I do not think it is going to do very much.
Certainly the track record of the Department of Employment and Immigration in finding jobs for people in this country is not that good so far. But the suggestion was made that there were people who were not looking hard enough. In other words, there were Canadians who were lazy, satisfied and content to be on unemployment insurance. I and others in this House reject that as a cynical indictment of Canadian workers, particularly of workers in our own area. The Hon. Member for Mississauga South (Mr. Blenkarn) made that comment yesterday and I pointed out to him and to the House that in my area people have gone all over Canada looking for jobs and have not been able to find them. I wish someone would show me where those 176,000 jobs are, and show the workers in my area, because they certainly want them.
The Member for Calgary South (Mrs. Sparrow), who spoke earlier, talked about the elements in Calgary that come from all over 'the country. I watched her on TV as she spoke about the steel from Ontario and materials from other parts of the country that were being used in Calgary. She said that it was a truly Canadian operation. I accept that. However, she forgot to mention that a lot of the workers there were from the Atlantic provinces. They are there because there are no jobs in the Atlantic provinces. They have had to go elsewhere to look for work.
As I see it, this particular effort is not going to address the needs of the people of Atlantic Canada. I do not see that the effect of this move by the Government will be job creation in the Atlantic provinces, either temporarily or in the long run. If it has a long-run effect, it will be very, very long run.
There are a lot of cuts besides those in unemployment insurance. Eight point five million dollars is being phased out of summer employment for young people. In the Province of Newfoundland 50 per cent of all eligible young people are unemployed. That is staggering. It is a tragedy, Mr. Speaker. I do not think those jobs for young people in the private sector will come overnight or next winter. What do we say to young people in the meantime? Canada student loans as well as other programs will also not be increased. They have depended on Summer Canada but $8.5 million is going to be phased out of that program. Mr. Speaker, if you were a representative of
that province, what would you say to the 50 per cent of young people who are unemployed? How would you explain that?
The Canadian Home Insulation Program is being phased out. I think there is a certain argument to be made in favour of that because that is certainly something that people should do on their own. It was an incentive program to encourage people to insulate and improve their houses at a time when energy was a factor and the housing industry needed a shot in the arm. The housing industry has picked up in some parts of the country but not in all parts. This particular move by the Government is indiscriminate. It treats all areas, groups and peoples alike. There is no consideration given for regional differences. The Canadian Home Insulation Program gave a lot of employment to small businesses, carpenters and electricians. It gave a lot of employment to many little people in the rural areas who depended on that program. What is their alternative?
With regard to the fisheries sector, $ 1.2 million has been cut which was designated for a marine service centre on the Labrador coast. The fishermen in that area are among the most disadvantaged of any in Canada. This will affect Inuit people and fishermen with small boats from small communities in Newfoundland who use those facilities in the summertime. That program was put in place because they need to catch up. It was put in place because the former government believed, as this Party now believes, that our job is to help first those who need it most and to put in place the things which they do not have but need to carry out their occupations. That $1.2 million was slashed indiscriminately with no thought given to what effect it will have on that particular area.
While the fishing industry in the Atlantic is on its knees and struggling for survival, $5 million is cut from the ad campaign attempting to sell fish in the United States. This comes at a time when, because of the strength of the U.S. dollar, the United States is buying a lot of European fish. I do not see how cutting $5 million from the fish promotion program squares with helping the private sector.
Relocation assistance was cut by $2.8 million. Labrador City, in my constituency, produces 50 per cent of all the iron ore in Canada. The Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) will know it well because he was president of the company that operated that particular town. Another town called Schefferville was closed down. I give the Prime Minister his due because he made sure that there were generous benefits made available to the people in Schefferville. I say publicly that that was a magnanimous stroke. Unfortunately, however, the same thing did not happen in Labrador City. There the company was allowed to use contract clauses to renege on severance payments to workers. They were allowed to treat workers as if they were on recall for three years rather than having been laid off. If there had been an upsurge in the iron ore industry in Canada, which everyone knew was not going to happen, at least not overnight, the workers would have been recalled. Therefore, the company was allowed to use that clause to avoid giving severance payments and the generous allowances which were given in Schefferville.
November 29, 1984

The Government of Canada had to step in and use a program called MILAP which was the successor to the Industrial Labour Adjustments Program. It was specifically designed to help workers, particularly in one-industry towns that had no alternative, to find either retraining or relocation. That is what must happen because even though industries may want to look out for the welfare of their employees, there are industries that cannot do it. These are Canadians who deserve, need and demand help. The Government of Canada must be responsible to help them but relocation assistance has been cut by $2.8 million when there are people with no prospects for alternative employment who need that help. I cannot accept that, Mr. Speaker. Separation payments, unemployment insurance and employment pension income is now going to be considered as income before people can start to draw those benefits anyway.
Returning to the housing industry, in Atlantic Canada and rural areas all across the country RRAP was an important program for people who wanted to renovate, rebuild or reconstruct their houses. A lot of senior citizens and people who could not build new houses took advantage of RRAP. A lot of small businesses that could not find alternatives and needed the work were surviving, to a large degree, on the RRAP program. That has now been cut by $29.4 million. I just hope that the private sector takes that up and the housing industry responds. I just hope that thete are job alternatives available for those people so that they will be able to afford it without the help of RRAP. However, I do not see that happening, at least not very quickly.
I would not like to talk about ferry services. I saw the Hon. Member for Malpeque (Mr. Gass) here earlier. I know he had to leave but I was hoping he would stay around. If he were here I think he would have to agree with me that to cut ferry services to an island is to cut off a lifeline. The House must understand that. If I did not explain that in the House I would not be doing my job as a representative in this Chamber. There is no other way, except to fly, to get to Prince Edward Island. There are many people who cannot afford to fly, or for some other reason cannot fly in. You cannot fly a tractor into Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland. Ever since we came into confederation in 1949 heavy equipment has been transported by ferry. That ferry service is our trans-Canada highway. It is the only highway we have to that island. The Government, the House and the people who make policy here must understand the effect that policy is going to have on people who live on islands.
I can accept helping the private sector and putting business front and centre. I can accept that in the long run that is the only way we are going to create permanent, lasting jobs in the country. I can accept all that. However, I cannot accept indiscriminate cutting with no thought of the effect it will have, particularly on disadvantaged areas of this country. There are cut-backs of $21.5 million in CN Marine. Airport and marine services are to be reduced and fees are to be increased.

Last week the Canadian Transportation Commission made what I believe to be one of its best reports. It concerned the North. In fact, it was a Conservative Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, who, in the 1960s, had a vision of the North. If he were in the Chamber today he would be supporting that Canadian Transportation Commission report. He would agree that it would be possible to attract and keep people in the North if the fuel tax and airport fees in the North were eliminated. This would develop the northern area of this country. But if an undue burden is placed on those who already have one of the heaviest burdens to bear in this country, it will decimate and depopulate the North. It will not only be Schefferville that will close down; many other towns in the North besides mining towns will close down. The point I am trying to get across is that the cuts we have seen in those areas of the country will be devastating. I do not see what the alternative will be.
In order to be a good representative of the people I represent, I should point out those measures that I find beneficial in the economic statement. In fact, some of its measures were good. For example, fishermen, loggers, mine operators and farmers may be eligible for a fuel sales tax rebate of three cents per litre beginning in December. That is a good step and I congratulate the Government for it.
Widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 64 will become eligible for the spouses' allowance program in the fall of 1985. That is a good move and the Government should be congratulated. The fact that veterans' pensions will be improved is a good step and I also congratulate the Government for that.
Finally, tax relief may be offered for termination benefits for workers in shutdowns of isolated one-industry towns. I bet it was the Prime Minister who put that in. The Government should be congratulated for that as well. Those are four measures that will help my people.
However, by and large, the message I must convey to the House is that these cuts will be devastating. I do not see what the alternatives will be. The suggestion is that private enterprise will in some way take up the slack, although we do not know when.
What is the record of private enterprise? In the fishery, for example, both major fishing companies in the Atlantic area were on their knees and virtually bankrupt. Our Government had to step in. The private sector was asked if it had any money to invest in these companies. No one in the private sector came forward to invest in the companies. Therefore, the Government of Canada invested money.
In the case of Fishery Products International, our government, along with the Government of Newfoundland, invested approximately $150 million. Much more must be invested if that company is to be financially stable. That industry is struggling and the record of private enterprise in that particular industry is anything but excellent.

November 29, 1984
Borrowing Authority
Therefore we must ask if we can have confidence in the private sector in that particular industry. While that confidence may come about in the future, in the meantime I see these cuts putting a burden on fishermen who can least afford to bear that burden. The effect of that invested money has been to help some of the banks perhaps, but it has not helped too many fishermen in any substantial way.
What about forestry? The Government has also helped in forestry. While that industry is in difficulty, it is not as severe as the fishery. When the Government helps an industry in the forestry sector to modernize a mill, for example, it means the addition of new technology. New technology in and of itself does not create new jobs but eliminates jobs. Therefore, as a result of giving health to the forest industry through stability and modernization, some jobs have been eliminated. There is a vacuum in job creation which I do not see being filled by the forestry sector.
What about mining? I have talked about one mining town in particular but I believe it is general knowledge that this industry all across Canada is struggling in a very tough market-place. While some are doing much better than others, there certainly will not be a dramatic growth in the mining industry in the near future. In the meantime, how will those jobs be provided?
We are told that we should not look to those major corporations and multinational firms to create the jobs but that the real vitality in the private sector will be in small business. I support that concept. In this respect I have a great deal of time for the President of the Canadian Federation of Small Business. However, I would ask him to give details of where those 176,000 jobs are that he talks about because I want to get after the firms that have them. While there no longer is a relocation allowance, I want to find a way to send my people there.
I have a lot of time for his organization because I believe that the vitality of the economy will be with small business. However, this revitalization will not occur if the Government takes such action as cutting tourism out of the Industrial Regional Development Program. That program is one of the major tools the Government has now to assist private enterprise. I might say that the tourism industry includes many small businesses and employs many semi-skilled and nonskilled people. I believe that that industry has great potential in this country and it is surely not an incentive for private enterprise if the Government does not allow it to qualify under the IRDP.
I repeat that while the economic statement has some good points, the over-all cuts will have a devastating effect in the Atlantic area and I do not see where the slack will be taken up or how those cuts will be healed by the private sector. I believe the Government must reconsider its policy in this respect, to see how it affects the disadvantaged areas of the country, particularly northern and rural areas. I would ask the Government to do that because, if it does not, it will eventually pay the political price and will not return to this Chamber with the kind of majority it has today.

Let me tell the Hon. Member that as a person who has spent nearly 20 years working with young people, there is one message that I do not want to give them. It is the message that the previous government gave them during the last 20 years, that the solution to the problem of jobs is to mortgage the future, to borrow money that we cannot afford to borrow and to create jobs that do not produce anything in this economy.
There are examples of some of the jobs that were created by this program. For instance, it was a young person's job to post CEIC posters, giving credit for the summer jobs to the Minister.
I am concerned about young people but I want them to learn something about the realities of life; the fact that jobs do not appear out of thin air and that make-work jobs are not necessarily jobs that create work. I want young people to learn that a free lunch is not a birthright.

Maybe the Hon. Member could give us a few details on that.

It is a good question. That is virtually what happened. The private sector was in trouble across the board. Some of the smaller companies are doing very well, but the major companies in Atlantic Canada were in real trouble. Most of them, with the exception of National Sea Products, were on the verge of bankruptcy, not because of either a Conservative, Liberal, or NDP government or the fishermen, or the stocks, or anything like that; it was their inability to compete in the marketplace with the Scandinavians and others. The private sector was just not doing the job. Both governments, the Government of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland, are in a partnership to try and do that particular job.
I made the point, and the point has been made again, that while I support, by and large, the theory that it has to be the private sector, and particularly small business, which creates long-term jobs, you have to question certain areas, particularly the one which the Hon. Member mentioned. The private sector's track record does not lead us to believe that it is going to do the kind of excellent job that we hope the private sector is going to be able to do.
I would like to take one more minute to speak about the fishermen. The situation for fishermen is even worse in some areas of the country. When the Hon. Member talks about devastation-and I raised this problem with the Minister of
Borrowing Authority
Employment and Immigration-there are in-shore fishermen in Newfoundland this year who will not get any benefits at all. In the community of Griquet, for example, on the northern peninsula of Newfoundland, there are probably 100 such fishermen. Probably the total fishing force of that community will not qualify for un employent insurance because the fish did not come.
This is something you have to appreciate about fishing. It is not quite the same as farming. First, there are not the same safety nets. Second, we are equally vulnerable to the kinds of hazards nature inflicts upon us. This year was a staggering year for the in-shore fishermen. Instead of cutting unemployment insurance, what the Government should be doing is instituting special programs to help those fishermen who are affected.

Member for Grand Falls-White Bay-Labrador and the Liberal Party of Canada is that $23 billion of new borrowing authority is not enough, that they would prefer perhaps $50 billion of new borrowing authority, money that would then at some point in time have to be repaid with interest?

I have to congratulate the Hon. Member for Grand Falls-White Bay-Labrador (Mr. Rompkey) on talking about the importance of having direct job creation programs, as he said, in rural areas, high unemployment areas. It appears to be a fixation with this Government to treat everybody across the country alike. As the Hon. Member said, they are doing away with direct job-creation programs.
We had an intervention from the Hon. Member for St. Boniface (Mr. Duguay). The Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) ""didn't understand it at all. He said the Minister of Employment and Immigration will be developing new programs to provide permanent jobs for our youth. Therefore, the Summer Canada program will as a result be terminated"".
How stupid, Mr. Speaker. You do not give a student looking for a job for the summer a permanent job. What he is really referring to is private enterprise. Private enterprise does not

exist in the high unemployment areas of the hon. gentleman's province. It does not exist. You must have direct job-creation programs. A community group applies for the program to carry out an activity. For somebody to stand in this House and say that was a waste of money and that the students were not doing anything is to criticize the local community group that applied to the government for the money.
If this Government is sincere about being concerned about students, it will have to turn around next summer and have the same kind of job creation program for students as the former Liberal government had. If it does not, then it can wave good-bye to any credibility which it has in high unemployment areas of Canada.

However, I have gained heart and confidence when I have heard utterings from the sea of blue from time to time.
At this particular time I am compelled to recall a certain passage from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. I should like to quote a passage from that bible and draw attention to the following well-known words:
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
The Liberals in their new-found station in life on the benches opposite, of course, will recognize that on September 4 Canadians said that it was the worst of times, that it was the age of foolishness, that it was the epoch of incredulity, that it was the age of darkness-and indeed it is for them-and that it was the winter of despair, which again is here for the Liberal party. If this is true, the Liberals will recognize that they were the authors of their own misfortune. Their hollow cries of objection can be nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction. If they paused and reflected, they would fully realize that they have created the mess in which we find ourselves today.
I have reservations about standing to support the massive borrowing Bill before us today, but there is no alternative. However, we on this side of the House believe, as the people of Canada agreed on September 4-and I am persuaded that they will reaffirm their belief in years to come-that this can be the best of times. They recognize that this is now a new age of wisdom, that we are at the commencement of a new epoch of belief, that there is a season of light, that we are on the dawn of a spring of hope and that we have everything before us. There is only one way to go, and that is up. Based upon the formulae, the confidence the Government has instilled in
Canadians and the principles enunciated in the economic statement, that is the path Canada will now take.
I compare the situation in Canada to a dike and the sea. For the past number of years we have had a drip and a drip and a drip, increasing to two drips and three drips, until many holes appeared in the dike on which only band-aids, splashes of cement or chewing gum were applied. They were band-aid measures. There has been such an increase in the holes in the dike that it is in danger of collapse. Now more than temporary mortar or temporary band-aids must be applied to deal with this situation.
What is needed are structural changes in the dike. We have to start all over again because what we have had until now has apparently not worked. We will consult with structural engineers and architects in Canada. We will convene meetings and enter into dialogue with masons, carpenters and all people who are part of the central ingredient of our economy. It takes time to draft a new structure. We cannot build by copying the last structure, the one which failed. We have to return to the drawing-board and start again.
That is the intention of the Government. We also intend to consult with all people who are essential to and form a necessary component or part of the economic structure of Canada. We have set a course of action to speak with the provinces, labour, business and the people. We have spoken with the people. We have touched upon possible solutions. We have given them an indication of where we might go, and they have applauded. However, we have only started. We have only given a hint, a blueprint. Now we must fill in the details. But that can be done only after realizing that we have consulted and listened. We will ensure that the repercussions of our plans will be minimal on any group or any person who feels aggrieved or adversely affected. This is the new process of consultation into which this Government enters.
Indeed, we are prepared to listen to Hon. Members opposite who from time to time have given us some constructive ideas on how we might proceed. The last speaker from Newfoundland indicated that he had no obligation or duty to propose, only to criticize. He contradicted what previous speakers in his Party said only yesterday. They indicated that they had an obligation to enter into the dialogue and to participate. This is what this Government and this Party invite all Hon. Members of the House to do-to be constructive rather than just critical.
As members of the House collectively and individually, we have an obligation to rethink the process. What we have today is what we asked for. We are where we are because that is what the people of Canada asked of us. We have responded to their pleas over the years in endeavouring, particularly at election time, to appease them and console them. Collectively we have failed. I suggest the reason we have collectively failed is that there has been no leadership to indicate the direction we should take. Now we have leadership, tarting with the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney), down to the Cabinet, down to the Conservative Party and down, I hope, to all Hon. Members of the House. The Prime Minister indicated by way of leadership
November 29, 1984

that he would take a personal salary cut. The members of his Cabinet indicated that they were prepared to accept a cut in salary. Leadership is starting from the very top. It is in the interests of this country to follow. We cannot survive and we will not respond unless we follow. Members of this Party are prepared to follow a new course, a new direction. We are prepared to accept that new attitudes are required in order to change the basic structure and philosophy of this country.
We have an obligation collectively and individually to go back to our ridings, our church halls, judo clubs, all our community enterprises, all those groups which are well merited, well meaning and an integral part of our whole system. We have to tell them that times have changed, that they must be an integral part of the new system, the new attitudes and the new philosophy, that they cannot now make their first approach to government. Everybody must say: ""Government is our very last resort"".
The philosophy prevailing, the course of action followed year after year, has been built into a habit that is almost irreversible. This has caused the dike to collapse. The attitude that must now be adopted by each one of us is to say: ""Government is a matter of last recourse"". We recognize there are certain persons in our society who are not able to respond and are not capable of handling their own circumstances. For those people we will provide, guarantee and ensure their stability and all their essential needs.
For all others for which there is an option, our thrust must now be: What can we do for ourselves? In order to ensure that there is some initiative, some stimulus, some new direction, we must ensure that there is this new ingredient, this new understanding, this new willingness, collectively and individually among all of us-you, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister, myself and all Members - in order for the welfare of this country to go forward and prosper. We must gather in a united effort and say: ""Yes, we are going to try something new"".
We have tried all the other means. We tried those remedies that parallel the rescue effort to stem the tide behind the dike. We have heard rumblings of water over here. We threw money. There was a hole on this side of the dike. We threw more money. We have had agitations. We tried more intermediate and shortterm solutions, but never in the last 25 years has a constructive, national effort been made to harmonize and gather together the will of the nation.
Why is it that people in Canada fight for the right not to work more but to work less? Why is it that it is government this, government that, government stimulus, government monies, and pogey? Where did all this come from?
What is it that goes on south of the border that makes people there so different? What is it that compels those people to gather in line-ups outside their cities at 5.30 in the morning, bumper to bumper, to go into the cities for the right and privilege to work? What compels them? What is the initiative? It is the initiative of prosperity. They realize they have the right to gather together and enjoy the fruits of their labour, to
Borrowing Authority
participate and enjoy the profits. That is a joy and a happiness which they have cherished, which they have mastered. There is a national will and a national consensus because there is national leadership. That is what we have lacked for the last number of years, leadership. That is the hope and the new dawn for Canada-new leadership and new attitudes.
What should this Government do? It should not employ any more people. Government payrolls are large. They are exhausted. The Government of Canada does not want to increase the number of employees. We want to let our employees go. Where are they going to go? They are going to go to the new jobs created by the new attitudes, new initiatives and new stimulus that this Government is going to provide.

I will give an example of how the people of Canada will respond to the new direction and the new initiatives.
In conversation the other day, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) indicated to us that he had received a telephone call from a gentleman 93 years of age. This gentleman had abandoned the economy and the business in which he had been involved. He had thrown up his hands and said: ""There is no hope, there is no reason, there is no encouragement and private enterprise has no place in this society"". That was some years ago when he was at the ripe old age of 85. He had been wandering, meandering, trying to find a path where he might proceed, the promised land, so to speak.

November 29, 1984
Borrowing Authority
After the economic message was delivered by the Minister of Finance, this 93 year old gentleman purchased a company employing 125 people. He indicated he has plans to add another 50 employees to the payroll of that company within the next six months.
When I hear my friends on repeated occasions asking: ""Where are the new jobs coming from? Give us some evidence, some indication that private companies and individuals will respond"", I give this as an example of what we can anticipate. There will not be 125 or 200 jobs, but hundreds and thousands of jobs created, because this is a new Canada. We do have new attitudes. Of course, on other occasions our friends have asked: ""Where are the jobs? You have been in business for two months"". It takes time to build a dike, Mr. Speaker. We must create and build a new dike. We must consult and that is the direction of this Government and Cabinet.
I should like to applaud the leadership of our Party. I ask my friends to enter into the dialogue in which we are involved and return to their constituents to say: ""What we tried before obviously did not work. There is new hope. Let us be constructive, let us get together"". This is a new era and a new beginning.

If the Hon. Member looks at tomorrows's Hansard, he will see that he did say that. I believe that that just is not true. The City of Halifax has an unemployment rate of over 12 per cent and it is the city that is the best off in Atlantic Canada. To suggest that the people of Atlantic Canada are not working because they do not want to work and would rather collect unemployment insurance benefits is to insult those people in a way which he or any other Member ought not to do.
How can the Hon. Member think that his have-not province can be helped when the Government has reduced the funding for regional economic expansion by $200 million? A substantial part of that funding would have gone to Atlantic Canada. How can the Hon. Member think that his region, a region in which two of the major industries are fishery and forestry, can prosper when the Government has reduced funding to research and development in those two fields by $1.5 million each? How does he think that the fishermen in his province can prosper when the ferry service from Yarmouth to Boston on which fish were transported at pretty low costs has been stopped? How can those fishermen be helped now when the ferry service has been taken away and they will have to travel hundreds of miles to deliver their produce, increasing the price they have to charge and making it more difficult to compete?

The situation in the industry has been rather chaotic in the past number of years. The plans of this Government relative to the fishing industry will give it a direction instead of hodge-podge, massive regulation and intervention by government.
With respect to economic development, what the Government is going to provide and what the province wants are incentives. The province wants investment. Where will that investment come from? It can come from two sources. It can come from within Canada and from outside our borders. Nova Scotia has benefited dramatically and perhaps more per capita than any other region in Canada from outside investment. As an example of this, I would mention Michelin, the biggest employer in Nova Scotia. I would mention Nova Scotia Forest Industries and Volvo. There are a large number of good foreign corporate citizens in Nova Scotia. Unfortunately, this investment has slowed down because of FIRA and the attitude toward foreign investment of the previous government. It is our intention to change those rules dramatically. Our province looks forward to a new era of prosperity because people from foreign lands are knocking on our doors. They wish to do business in Nova Scotia, a province in which the people want to work and which has the climate for prosperity and making a real profit.

Member for Halifax (Mr. Mclnnes), in which he said that they will be providing new stimuli for industry and help for small businesses, I find it very difficult to understand what he means. I think we do not give quite the same meaning to the words we use, especially when we are talking about the tourist industry. In his statement, the Hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) announced a number of cutbacks that will have a specific impact on ferry services in the Atlantic provinces, services that are vital to the tourist industry. It is going to cost a lot more to use the ferry. We are increasing admission fees to National Parks, airport taxes and the excise tax on alcoholic beverages Mr. Speaker, when those very same Members were in the opposition last spring they were deploring the fact that the Government was taking such measures. Now, they refer to them as stimuli.
I wish the Hon. Member would explain how these cutbacks could act as a stimulus for the tourist industry.

There is prima facie some merit in what the Hon. Member has said. There may be an adverse reaction in the tourism industry. The tourism industry is a very important component of my constituency and is important to all Nova Scotians. However, I have had the benefit of analysis and consultations with people in the tourist trade. They have persuaded me, as I would echo to the Hon. Member, that in order to continue to encourage tourists to come to Canada, and particularly to Nova Scotia, we must build an infrastructure. We must ensure that proper tourist facilities are in place. The quality of our tourist trade has deteriorated in the last few years. There are fewer people coming to Nova Scotia now than there were five years ago. Again, it is a very basic problem.
We need some new money to build up the infrastructure to ensure that we can compete with other countries for the tourist dollar. That is the intention of these new tolls and raises. They again provide short-term pain but we need new funds. We cannot keep grabbing and grabbing from nowhere. There must be something there to grab. That is what it is all about.

This decision will mean the doubling and, in some cases, the tripling of the insurance costs to fishermen, when they go to private insurance companies. Worse than that, it will mean that a great many of the fishermen-I estimate about half of the boat owners in Newfoundland-will not qualify for insurance from private insurance companies. The real problem arises in that the provincial Fisheries Loan Board demands that fishermen must have insurance before they can get loans from provincial government boards. Any insurance policies which are cancelled in the meantime will obviously mean that the loans will become due.
I would strongly suggest that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Mr. Fraser) and the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) should at least consult with the provincial Governments, the processors, the fishermen's unions and the insurance companies, and revise the decision which was made.

I am referring to the grape surplus that has been anticipated by the farming community since last June. The problem has arisen for several reasons, the primary reason being the dumping of subsidized European wines in Canada. These low-priced imports have caused a decreased demand for domestic wines,

November 29, 1984
which is unfortunate, because my constituents and I have known for some time that the Niagara Peninsula contains some of the world's finest wine producing land.
Last July when the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) visited the area he assured the farmers that, just as in previous Conservative administrations, their concerns would not be forgotten and the surplus would be taken up. Therefore, I was extremely pleased when this past week the Department of Agriculture began mailing cheques to our grape producers, covering 100 per cent of the surplus at 100 per cent of the cost-again demonstrating this Government's commitment to the agricultural community. Therefore, four years from now, farmers, along with other Canadians, are going to be able to say: ""There were promises made, but more important, those promises were kept"".

I want to draw the attention of the House to a situation that is prevalent in Canada Employment Centres. The way public servants who dispense the services of this Department deal with clients is absolutely appalling. I often hear about such things from my constituents, and from conversations I have had with my hon. colleagues, I understand the same is true elsewhere. It is bad enough to be unemployed, but being treated without respect is even worse. For instance, it is impossible to get through to an Employment Centre officer by phone, since the lines are always busy. People have to deal with several officers who fail to provide for follow-up. On top of that there is a lot of waiting in line, and once they get to the counter, people are often told to see another officer. The impression is that courtesy is definitely expendable. 1 therefore think it is absolutely essential the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald) be made aware of the way services are offered in Employment Centres, so that the Minister will be able to act without delay to humanize the process in all offices across Canada.
I would like to remind Hon. Members that Parliament and the Administration are supposed to serve the people of this country and not the other way around. This is something that was forgotten by the previous Government.

To prove this guarantee was genuine, the Minister of Employment and Immigration pointed out past commitments, including the program for sponsoring refugees from IndoChina, started in 1979 when she headed the Department of External Affairs. The program was organized as follows: the Government would sponsor one refugee for each refugee sponsored by a private group. This program is not a very convincing example, because the Minister will recall that five months after the program was introduced, it was terminated by the Progressive Conservative Government which preferred to let the United Nations provide assistance to Cambodia. This decision put private sponsors in a difficult situation, since they then had to take charge of the refugees the Government had promised to sponsor. Therefore, although I certainly do not for a moment doubt the Minister's good faith, I will take her promises with a grain of salt, and I remain convinced that some drastic changes are in the offing with respect to our immigration policy.

In some cases the reductions have come in the form of closures all day Saturday and Wednesday afternoon. The announcement has caused considerable concern to the small communities. Postal services are, for many people, a critical and vital part of their personal and business concerns.
The people of Fundy-Royal understand that the Post Office Corporation is committed to providing efficient and effective service while attempting to whittle away its massive debt. Flowever, there is a general fear that rural service is being sacrificed in the effort. In the past few years rural communities have witnessed a steady deterioration of services, most particularly the elimination of Saturday delivery. They do not want to see their service further reduced.
Closure of post offices on Saturday eliminates the only opportunity a great many patrons have for using postal facilities. Reduced hours of operation place additional restrictions on the accessibility of rural residents to this essential service. The post office is the lifeblood of many small and rural communities, and such cut-backs are always sorely and deeply felt.
I urge the Postmaster General and his officials to study carefully the effects of these closures on the affected communities, and recommend that the services and hours of operation previously provided to these patrons be maintained.

I hope the Minister of Communications supports the position taken by the Federation, Mr. Speaker. The CBC French network's radio and television programs are sometimes the only source of information in French for most francophone communities outside Quebec.
It is absolutely vital that the Minister of Communication immediately inform the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that French local and regional programming outside Quebec is an inviolable part of the CBC's mandate.

We in this Party were amazed to learn that the minister brought in a reduction of $200 million to the IRDIA Program. In particular, he has savaged the tourism industry by making projects under IRDIA ineligible for tourism. This will have a great effect on a lot of small tourist operators right across the country, in particular in those poorer regions of Canada which have based their small economies on the tourism industry.
I realize, Mr. Speaker, that some of this will be taken up by provincial and federal agreements on tourism, but the small operator in Atlantic Canada, in Quebec or western Canada, does not have any access whatsoever to dollars under the IRDIA Program. I urge the Minister of State for Tourism, and in particular the minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, to change these regressive policies and replace them with what existed previously.

The results of a survey indicate that 48 per cent of the respondents stated that they have some income from work outside their home, and 80 per cent of those working women are paid less than $15,000 a year. Seamstresses and baby-sitters are paid between 30 cents and $1.50 an hour and 51 per cent of them would like to work outside their home if they could.
Consequently, most women in Lotbiniere, that is 76 per cent, are not financially independent.

Studies done for processors further indicate that this longstanding problem will get worse unless the supply of industrial milk in Ontario is increased.
It is ironic that, although Ontario has 40 per cent of Canada's population, the province is allowed only 31.3 per cent of Canada's production of industrial milk. The Province of Quebec has 48 per cent of the national quota, which is surplus to its needs. Processors there are selling tons of butter and skim milk powder to the federal dairy commission which exports these products, often at prices below cost. A better and more realistic way would be for the Ontario processors to be given an opportunity to buy the surplus quota from Quebec.
Therefore I call upon the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Wise) to use his good offices to look into this longstanding problem and come forth with solutions that would assure the continued viability of the cheese and butter industry of Ontario, which is facing a very difficult time.

Turner (Leader of the Opposition):,Leader of the Official Opposition,ORAL QUESTION PERIOD,ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE,UNLICENSED CABLE TELEVISION OPERATORS-STAY OF PROSECUTIONS,"Mr. Speaker, I address my question to the Prime Minister. A report in The Globe and Mail of November 27 suggests that the Prime Minister intervened with the Attorney General of Canada in order to have the Attorney General desist from prosecuting unlicensed cable television operators after he had already given the go-ahead to prosecute. The story says that the word came from the Prime Minister's Office.
I want to outline the importance of the question, Sir. I believe the principle has been established, both in this Parliament and at Westminster, that the discretion to prosecute by an Attorney General is an unfettered one and must not be interfered with or influenced by political considerations, even by his Cabinet colleagues. Sir Harold Macmillan stated the principle clearly when he said: ""A tradition long supported by all political parties is that the decision whether any citizen should be prosecuted or whether any prosecution should be discontinued should be a matter for the prosecuting authorities to decide on the merits of the case without political or other pressure.""
My question is: Did the Prime Minister or his staff direct that the Attorney General of Canada desist from that prosecution?

The Government has increased the petroleum compensation charge from $4.19 to $6.54 per barrel. At the same time the export charge for Canadian crude oil has been lowered from $6.43 a barrel to $4.68 a barrel and is currently in place at the lower rate. As the Minister well knows, this results in Canadian crude being sold on the U.S. markets at a price cheaper than it can be purchased in Canada by Canadian refineries. Why does the Government permit this to occur?
Hon. Pat Carney (Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources): Mr. Speaker, the issue addressed by the Hon. Member is a good example of why we are moving away from the terribly rigid pricing apparatus which was imposed by the previous administration. The problem that arises is that, in the very competitive oil and gas market which we face today, Chicago prices are below current world prices. That gives us a problem at the border. When we go to world prices, as we have indicated we will, we will be able to avoid this type of problem.

Hon. Pat Carney (Minister of Energy, Mines and

It gives me an opportunity to explain that the previous administration left us with a $1 billion deficit in that account, because they broke their own agreement and refused to raise prices last year in the middle of their leadership campaign when they should have done so. We have a $1 billion deficit which we must deal with. We are dealing with it in negotiations with the provinces. At this moment we are not in position to remove that charge on the Canadian consumer.

-the Conservative Government is questioning the traditional arms-length relationship governments have had with the CBC and other cultural agencies, and is moving rapidly to apply a direct political hand to cultural policy.

If debate on Bill C-7 is concluded, we will then move to the consideration in Committee of the Whole of Bill C-9, an Act to amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff. Should consideration of Bill C-9 be completed, we will then return to consideration at second reading of Bill C-l 1, an Act to provide borrowing authority.
Tomorrow the order of business will be the same, Bill C-7, Bill C-9 and Bill C-l 1 at whatever stage they are then at.
I want on this occasion to designate this coming Monday as the fourth allotted day in the current supply period.
On Tuesday the first order of business, due to a great deal of public demand, will be Bill C-6, an Act to amend the Saltfish Act. It is my understanding that there is agreement among the parties to deal with this Bill at all stages in the House on Tuesday. If the Saltfish Bill is passed before the end of the day, we will return to the consideration of Bills C-7, C-9 and C-l 1, in that order.
On Wednesday the order of business will be the following: Bill C-7, if not previously disposed of, followed by Bill C-9, followed by Bill C-l 1. If the Bills that I have enumerated have been disposed of, the House will at that stage commence consideration of Bill C-l2, an Act to amend the Excise Tax Act and the Excise Act.
We will observe the progress of the House with respect to the legislation that I have enumerated. It is always subject to a change in the order of business, depending on the progress and circumstances.

We are interested in proceeding with these items at an early date for a very good reason. It has been recognized by the Government, and the Minister of Finance will address this, that after a Budget is brought down there is some uncertainty with respect to the specific legislation that will be passed by Parliament to bring into effect items specified in the Budget. We have brought these matters before the House as a result of the Budget which was brought forward by our predecessor government in February, 1984. We have done this at the earliest possible date with a view to bringing clarity and certainty to the people of Canada regarding the Budget that did pass.
My colleague, of course, will address the specific question. However, I did want to put on record that we are beginning to clean up the matters left hanging by the previous government. There are great and better things to come.

The first change clarifies the timing surrounding the small business tax simplification measures. These measures will be effective for 1985 and subsequent tax years in an effort to provide greater certainty for taxpayers by defining the date precisely.
The second change is that the small corporation test for eligibility for the 35 per cent rate of credit on research and development and for the 40 per cent rate of refundability of the investment tax credit for an extra month to pay any balance of tax is now to be based on taxable income for the preceding rather than the current tax year. This is also a clarification to provide more certainty and more precision in that planning.

In addition, the special rule to prevent corporations from obtaining the low rate when they are controlled by means of options by public corporations or non-residents is being deferred to apply beginning in 1986 rather than in 1985 so as to provide taxpayers with adequate time to rearrange their affairs.
The exemption from foreign property penalty rules for registered pension plans created for the exclusive benefit of non-residents employed outside Canada is being extended to other plans which, although not created for that purpose, in fact operate for the exclusive benefit of such persons. The proposal of last February to increase from 90 days to 120 days the time to file a notice of objection is not being proceeded with, due to more efficient procedures being introduced at Revenue Canada. As a result, the motion for this measure has been dropped.
There was also a proposal in February which would require the Minister of National Revenue to accept satisfactory security for disputed taxes. That is not being proceeded with in view of the work which is actively under way which will allow for the postponement of payment of such taxes until there has been a court resolution of the matter.

It says to Parliament and the people of Canada that we have to cut various essential services because we cannot afford them. We have this tremendous deficit. Mr. Chairman, a big part of the reason we have these tremendous deficits is that the Income Tax Act is riddled with hundreds of sections which permit special groups to get special consideration so that they pay less than they should be paying. We have the banks, the most profitable corporations of this country, paying a smaller rate of tax than the bank teller pays in income tax. This goes all through the system, and I think it is time that the Government and Parliament faced up to this.
We learned something from a royal commission appointed by an earlier Conservative government under Mr. Diefen-baker, the Carter Commission, which brought down a report which said some very fundamental things about income. A dollar of income is a dollar of income regardless of how you get it. It is just dead wrong to assess people whose income is earned through wages or salaries at one rate, and assess people with income from investments at another rate.
Let me give you one example, that of the child tax credit. A person is permitted to deduct up to $1,000 in child expenses. That is a gift to the rich, because the person with a high income will save $500, a person with a medium income will save $250, and a person with a low income who has the expenses will save virtually nothing. I raise that as just one illustration of what is wrong with the tax system.
I know I speak for all members of my Party when I say I object very strenuously to this clause which will permit doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals this tax break. They do very well, better than most Canadians. They are in the highest income brackets in this country, and I object

very much to a proposal which will permit them to pay tax at a lower rate than others.

Yet it seems that the proposal in Clauses 51 and 53 may in fact have the effect of excluding those who choose to form a co-operative farm from the right to roll over their property from one generation to the next.
The Minister will be aware that Revenue Canada says at the moment that when four or five family members form a cooperative, it is virtually impossible to turn the land in that co-operative over to the next generation on a roll-over basis. The Department deems the operators in that case not to be actively involved in the farm.
I want to make certain that co-operative farms operating under those conditions will get the same changes that are proposed in this Bill as are being offered to those who have chosen to set themselves up as small corporations, at which time the shareholders are considered to have been active

We are almost at the end of 1984. The scheme is very straightforward if one is dealing with that period. The maximum amount is $120,000.

1 just wonder if the Government is adopting the former Liberal government's policy with regard to taxable capital gains on farmland, whether it is being adopted in Bill C-7 and perhaps further amplified on the basis of the report of the parliamentary committee, or is this the Government's position with regard to taxable capital gains on farm property at least

These are the sections where we get into the problem that I had alluded to earlier with farmers who have chosen to set themselves up under a co-operative structure. I should get clarification from the Minister since she has her experts with her.
Does this description of a taxpayer in a corporation in paragraph (b) on qualified farm property include the type of
co-operative that I was talking about just a few moments ago where the property is either held under a co-operative in fee simple in title or, which is the more likely case, the land is held by individual shareholders in the co-operative and they have chosen instead to operate a farming co-operative. This particular aspect of the Bill deals with qualified farm properties. This would affect those properties where the land is owned by the co-operative. Are those properties also eligible to be rolled over to the next generation through a transfer of shares? Are they eligible for the RRSP benefit, or have they been missed?

Perhaps when we finish with the questioning we could stand the clause and go on with other parts of the Bill. I am curious as to whether the definition of a full-time farmer would include a farmer operating along with a group of farmers in a co-operative. This is the other side of the coin to the first question. Revenue Canada has not done a very good job of addressing this matter and that is partly the reason I am raising it today. I have written letters to Ministers of Finance and I believe to the Secretary of State for Finance as well concerning this issue. What happens is that Revenue people tend to see farmers operating together in a co-op mode as being neither fish nor fowl. They are not able to transfer their property under the roll-over provision because the Department says they must be actively farming the land they are proposing to roll over to their sons, daughters or grandchildren. The requirements of Revenue Canada now are that the land must be farmed for two or three years by the donor or two or three years by the receiver prior to the roll-over provision taking place. Because co-operatives have been omitted from the Act, anybody engaged in that sort of farming is not permitted a roll-over. Consequently, many co-operative farms are having to die after the current generation of farmers reach a retirement age simply because there is no easy way for them to transfer the farm to their children.
Similarly, I want to be quite sure before we pass this Bill that we do not also discriminate against co-operative farmers who want to sell out, whether to their children or to others. I see no reason why they should be discriminated against when they are now permitting people who have structured themselves in a regular corporate manner to have access to these

That answer just does not make sense. An individual taxpayer who has been assessed wants to have 180 days rather than 90 days to file that appeal, consult with an accountant and so on. The efficiency of the taxation branch does not have anything to do with the appeal period. The convenience is for the taxpayer. The taxpayer has more time to review the situation, to consult and to decide whether he or she wants to appeal. I do not see what the efficiency of the tax branch has to do with this appeal period. The provisions in the previous Ways and Means resolution were more helpful to the taxpayer who wanted to appeal than the provision in the Bill before us this afternoon.

The taxpayer took up a good deal of the 90 days trying to find out what the tax branch wanted. There have been better lines of communication with the tax branch. The explanations given initially are more detailed, more reasonable and written in language that people can understand. I am sure that the Minister of National Revenue could go into this in considerably more detail. Those are two or three examples of why he feels this period to be adequate.

It seems to me that the clock starts ticking from the moment the notice of assessment is sent out. We do not know how rapidly those notices are received.

-Canadian fishermen and companies must be encouraged and assisted to modernize their boats ... A Progressive Conservative Government will promote the orderly development of a middle-distance fleet and the present 65-foot upper limit on longliners will be removed.
At various times, prior to the Government coming into power, the Progressive Conservative Party stated its intention to deal fairly and, certainly as it has stated, in a better way, with fishermen than did the previous government.
In looking at the policies which were outlined by the Government, one wonders when they will be instituted. Certainly, they will cost a lot of money. There have been various actions announced by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Mr. Fraser), as well as the various actions which were contained in the Economic Statement of the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson).
For example, fishermen will now be charged for the maps they obtain from the federal government which show the coastline. There was a statement by the Minister of the Environment (Mrs. Blais-Grenier) which indicated that persons would be required to pay for their calls to the weather office. Then the Minister of the Environment clarified that by saying that fishermen would be excluded. In other words, there would be certain occupational groups-because they need weather forecasting information, sometimes on an urgent basis due to ever-changing weather patterns-who would not be charged for the telephone call. It is another policy to the detriment of the fishermen, because they will hesitate before contacting the weather office in their area.
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans also announced that berthage fees would be doubled. Not only that, but as I understand it after checking with the Department of Fisheries, in areas where the berthage fee was not previously charged it will now be charged on an equal basis right across Canada.
The Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald) announced that there would be no special program for fishermen who had a bad fishery this year. Those fishermen went out day after day looking for fish but they could not find the fish. Eventually, when the fishermen realized that the Government was not going to have a special program, such as the one that the previous government had last fall, they kept
going out day after day until they had obtained enough fish to get low unemployment insurance stamps. A great many of them will live throughout the winter receiving welfare along with low unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans then announced that the vessel insurance plan would be discontinued. Sometimes cuts are justified in government Departments. We certainly need more policies from the Department of Fisheries, which are to the advantage of Fishermen. However, certain cuts are announced and decided by someone who looks down from on high and who thinks that an insurance shceme which is run by the government should really be run by private enterprise. Many arguments cannot be put against that philosophy. However, if we examined why the policy was implemented in the mid-fifties, we would discover that it was brought in for one reason. That reason is that there are certain types of fishermen in Canada who do not qualify for private insurance schemes. I suppose that anyone could qualify if they were willing to pay the money. It depends on how high the rate is. But a fisherman with a small boat which is tied to a wharf on the northern peninsula in Newfoundland will not qualify through a private insurance company.
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Finance have to realize that they should have consulted with the provincial governments, provincial loan boards, processors, the fishermen's union of Newfoundland, fishermen and the insurance companies before they decided to cancel this scheme. The reason is quite simple. The reason is that fishermen who have insurance policies through the federally-run vessel insurance plan, must have those insurance policies before they can obtain loans through provincial loan boards. That insurance must be in place. The money must come out of the fisherman's pocket. It is not a part of the loan which is granted by the local loan board.
The effect of this measure, which was ill-conceived and implemented without consultation with the people involved in the fishery or the insurance companies, will be that over the next couple of weeks each provincial loan board will have to decide what it will do when the insurance is cancelled, because a condition of the loan was that the fishermen involved must have that insurance policy.
The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans would be well-advised to have that consultation now and to adjust the program to meet the needs of the fishermen. There are a great many problems in the fisheries. If the solution to those problems is to get rid of the fishermen, then this is a great way to do it.
There has been much discussion in the House since the debate began on borrowing authority concerning social programs and the actions of the Minister of Employment and Immigration as they relate to the Unemployment Insurance Commission. There has been much discussion regarding the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and its claim that it has identified 170,000 jobs which people in Canada could fill. One has to look at the people who draw unemploy-
November 29, 1984

ment insurance and understand their problems before initiating a policy which will drastically affect them, Mr. Speaker.
Of all the jobs available to people drawing unemployment insurance, there is only one sure thing available right now, the 700 investigators' jobs announced by the Minister of Employment and Immigration to try to take people off unemployment insurance. These being the only available jobs that I know of, I suggest that everyone on unemployment insurance write to the Minister and apply for one of those jobs. Surely the Minister would look favourably upon some of these applications because someone doing that kind of investigation should have experienced being on uenmployment insurance.
There are various reasons for the attitude on the part of the Government and a great many Canadians that people drawing unemployment insurance are ripping off the system. That is the attitude of a great many people, including some Members in this Chamber.
I suppose that if you look at the Auditor General's reports you will find some reason to justify that opinion. For example, a Member said this morning that there were several hundred thousand people who had quit their jobs and then drew unemployment insurance. In the Auditor General's report, where most of these figures are found, you see reference to this enormous number of people who had received overpayments or to the UIC paying out X number of millions of dollars when it should not have. You have to realize, Mr. Speaker, that included in that group is a very large number of people who received unemployment insurance because the UIC made a mistake. It is the law in this country that if the UIC makes the mistake, the person has to pay the money back. If the employer made the mistake, the person who received the money must pay it back. If you leave your home community and go some place looking for work and the UIC was not notified, and you are found out, you also have to pay back your benefits for that period of time. Included in that group of people who received unemployment insurance and should not have were those who had helped someone build their house or, if it is a fisherman, who had built a boat during the winter. That person was found out by one of the UIC investigators and he had to pay back all the benefits he received during the entire winter. So, Mr. Speaker, when you look at the figures you have to realize what these cases are, how these overpayments were created, and why that person owed the money to the UIC.
We have seen countless thousands of cases over the last few years of people who received benefits but were then declared not entitled to them by the Commission or its investigators. These people then go before a board of reference and they have the right of appeal to a deputy minister, or to the federal Court of Canada if it is a determination of a question by Revenue Canada, or to an umpire who is also a federal judge.
When you go over some of these cases, Mr. Speaker, you will discover extreme hardship cases. There are people with absolutely no income, and now they owe the federal Government a large amount of money. Those people are included in
Borrowing Authority
the figures tossed about by politicians, the business community and advocates of cutting back unemployment insurance. There are countless cases involving people who, through no fault of their own, have to pay money back to the UIC after receiving it for several years. If there is any humanitarianism in the system at all, Mr. Speaker, if the Minister has any sympathy for these people at all, there is a section in the Act which says that in cases of hardship the Commission can give the money owed to it. It would do far more for the Canadian people if the Minister were to examine that option rather than announcing that she is going to cut $200 million from unemployment insurance and hire 700 people to Find low paying jobs for the unemployed.
Another question comes to mind, Mr. Speaker. These low-paying jobs that I referred to are just that. They have to be low paying because the Federation of Independent Businesses claims that people on unemployment insurance are too comfortable, that they will not accept jobs that pay less than unemployment insurance. Well, you get 60 per cent of your earnings while drawing unemployment insurance. An Hon. Member referred the other day to the fact that the average pay-out to a person on unemployment insurance is $155 a week. He was wrong because it is $155.88 a week. That 88 cents means an awful lot to a poor person sitting in a high unemployment area, and that is all the income he or she gets. The average period of time that someone receives unemployment insurance in Canada, as any Hon. Member knows, is 24 weeks, not a year as was intimated in the statement by the business community the other day. What I am getting at is this. If you are going to put these people into the low paying jobs the Federation is talking about, then you are discriminating against the younger person who has no income at all. You are discriminating against the person who is looking for work and not collecting unemployment insurance. The Minister could turn around and say: ""Oh, no, we are really going to be trying to put these people as well into those jobs"". Well, if so, the Government is not going to save the $200 million that the Minister talked about. She cannot have it both ways. It is one way or the other.

He said: Mr. Speaker, I shall not waste the time of the House by re-reading this private Member motion. One never ceases to be amazed at the surprises one gets in the House. We had a draw a couple of weeks ago and I was the one hundred and fifty-third person on that draw. Lo and behold, by last night my turn had come up. I was rather pleased because the subject matter of this motion of mine today is very germane to the public concerns regarding the state of our criminal justice system in Canada. 1 am very pleased that we are able to discuss this motion for an hour tonight. I hope that Opposition and government members will see fit to allow this motion to pass.
I would like to discuss this subject under four main headings. The first will be the background to the motion. Second, I will deal with the two principal objectives that such a maximum security prison would serve. Third, I will discuss the justification and feasibility behind this proposal. Fourth, I will discuss why I feel the Government should allow this to be approved and passed today.
I will first discuss the background behind todays private Members' motion. Members of the House who have been here for approximately 10 years will recall that back in 1976-77 and prior to that there was a lot of unrest in our prison system. As a result, the government of the day set up a special subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs to study the penitentiary system in Canada. That committee had 13 members. If Members here are interested in the average life expectancy of a Member in the House of Commons, of those 13 Members only two are left; the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Nielsen) and myself.
We presented that report in 1977 to the Solicitor General who had commissioned it. It dealt in some detail with the problem of the criminal justice system in Canada and changes that should be made. The committee made 65 recommendations, which were subsequently studied by the officials and the Minister. This report was unusually well received across the country and abroad. We have had requests from outside the country for copies of this report. I feel it had a very enlightened approach to the subject of prison reform. Some of the recommendations were far-reaching. In fact, they were too far-reaching for the officials in the correctional service of Canada at that time. I might add that they are still too far-reaching for the present thinking of many of the officials in the CSC.
I will read recommendation No. 63 which is germane to our discussions today. It stated the following:
The Canadian penitentiary service should carry out an in-depth study of the feasibility and viability of penal communities in reasonably inaccessible areas as an alternative to confinement in conventional institutions for inmates serving long sentences without eligibility for parole.
This recommendation, along with the other 64, was studied from time to time by the various governments since 1977.
Between 1977 and 1981 no less than seven progress reports were issued. I have copies here of five of the progress reports and summaries of the others. It is curious to read these in retrospect because each one says almost the same thing as the last one. They are going to do a study. They are going to do more research. They are going to consult with this body or this country. It is an ongoing litany of what looks, in retrospect, to be attempts to put off a decision in this particular area.
It has become so ludicrous, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to read from two of them. I will first refer to the progress report dated November 1, 1979 made by the Solicitor General of the day, now the Hon. Member for Durham-Northumber-land (Mr. Lawrence). It reads as follows:
Research into this concept has been conducted and the major difficulties faced are the still relatively small numbers of inmates serving long sentences without eligibility for parole-
Parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, that may well have been true then. I dare say it was, but it certainly is not true now. Times have changed since 1979. The report goes on:
-coupled with the unknown factor of public acceptance of the concept itself.
I will address that in my remarks as I go on. The report continues:
In the meantime, individual programs are designed for and with each such long term offender. This will provide us with experience and knowledge upon which a viable program could be presented with the hope of obtaining widespread public support for its implementation.
I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that public support has now arrived. I will now quote from the final progress report on the implementation of the parliamentary sub-committee on the penitentiary system in Canada prepared for the former Solicitor General. It is dated June 5, 1981. I would like to read again under the heading ""Recommendation 63"". It reads as follows:
At the same time, the Service has co-operated in the formation of a Ministry Committee whose task it will be to direct and co-ordinate research and information-gathering on the various aspects of long term incarceration. This committee will give consideration to the advisability of conducting further research into the concept of penal communities.
November 29, 1984

In 1981, after having the original report for over four years, they are still saying that they are going to conduct further research into the concept of penal communities. They may well have been conducting further research, but I can assure you that we are not seeing the products of it at the present time. That suggests to me, Mr. Speaker, that we have a problem in the House of Commons. Indeed, we have more than one problem with the way this place runs, but during the existence of this report from the special sub-committee we have had no less than five Solicitors General in a seven year period. That is not even one and one-half years per Solicitor General. We wonder why we are not coming to grips with the prison system in this country. The current Solicitor General (Mr. MacKay) has only had a couple of months in office and I do not expect he will have been able to get a handle on the matter. Even so, imagine having four Solicitors General in a period of seven years and still not being able to finalize the research! They were talking about research at the beginning of this whole thing and were still talking about it in 1981 when we got the last report. We do not know what has become of that to this date.
On the subject of the background, we have recently had a rash of murders in the country, especially murders of policemen. We have had six or seven murders in the last two or three months. Unfortunately, one of those murders was in my constituency of Oxford in the City of Woodstock. It was in consequence of a similar murder one or two nights before in Montreal allegedly by the same suspects. There is a great deal of feeling, not only in my riding but across the country, about what we are going to do with the kinds of offenders who are in the mood, from time to time, to murder other law-abiding citizens, whether they be policemen, prison guards or whatever. Something needs to be done.
In an attempt to assess the problem in my constituency, I discovered that many people like myself do not support capital punishment, although a great majority of them are in favour of it. I also talked to Ruth Ross, who is the widow of OPP Constable Jack Ross who was shot in Woodstock. While she is sympathetic to the possible need for capital punishment, she is also very sympathetic to changing our criminal justice system in this country.
Recently she was interviewed by the Woodstock Sentinel-Review, which is the daily paper in our constituency. It was a rather lengthy interview which was conducted only two weeks ago, on November 15. I have been attempting to arrange a meeting between Mrs. Ross and the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) so that she could relate some of her feelings as a widow. As a matter of fact, the Primer of Ontario is also trying to arrange such an appointment for Mrs. Ross here in Ottawa.
The article states:
Mrs. Ross said she would attempt to bring to Mulroney's attention an immediate need to tighten the country's parole system.
Maximum Security Prison
It goes on to quote Mrs. Ross as follows:
""Nobody gives a thought about the victims (of serious crimes)"", she said. ""Serious crimes are happening every day"".
Finally, it states:
Mrs. Ross said she strongly believes hard-core criminals in Canada's penal system: ""Will never be rehabilitated"".
Nowhere in that article is there any mention of capital punishment. While she had some sympathy for those who want capital punishment when I talked to her, she saw no reason to raise it in this interview. This suggests to me that many Canadians are looking for alternatives to capital punishment. I suggest that the motion before the House today offers that kind of alternative. Let me outline the two objectives behind the establishment of such a maximum security prison. The primary objective, I suggest, would be the protection of society.
I believe that incarceration institutions in our society serve three main purposes. The first is to protect society. The second is to serve as a form of punishment, and the third, but not necessarily the last, is, hopefully, to assist in rehabilitating an inmate to become a good citizen in our society.
Let me deal with the first objective of protecting society. I briefly described the incident in Woodstock which has put the need for protection for society into perspective for people in my area. At the present time there are hardened criminals serving time in our institutions alongside those who are less inclined to have a criminal type of personality. However, due to the overcrowded conditions, they are exposed to hard-core prisoners when this should not be the case. The time has come for us to relieve the pressure of overcrowding in prisons while establishing a type of prison for habitual criminals or those sentenced to life that is located in a remote area, such as this motion provides for.
The second objective of this motion reflects the need to improve the criminal justice system in this country. Members are aware that we are currently unable to keep certain prisoners incarcerated once they have served their sentence. While there may be a good reason for that, the inadequacy of our present laws allows people to leave prison when we know they may commit further and usually more serious crime than the first offence.
The overcrowding also leads to unrest and an increased level of violence in the prisons. This is a deterrent to those prisoners who want to be rehabilitated, and we must find a better way than these special handling units for segregating these people. There should be another mechanism for segregating hardened criminals from those who want to learn to help themselves while at the same time providing the degree of protection that Canadians are seeking.
In the time I have remaining let me say a few words about the justification and feasibility of the concept behind this motion. I have suggested there is an urgent need to deal with this issue as a result of the unrest in our prisons and in our society owing to the number of homicides that we are witnessing today. There is also a need to show people that we are

November 29, 1984
Maximum Security Prison
concerned about what is happening. This concern could be expressed by the establishment of such an institution in a remote area, whether in the Northwest Territories or on a remote island. The reason for putting a prison in such an area is that the environment itself would act as a perimeter control. The Hon. Member for Western Arctic (Mr. Nickerson) could attest to the fact that if anyone escaped from a prison in the Northwest Territories he would either freeze to death in the winter or be eaten by bugs in the summer. If the prison is situated on a remote island, the same environmental control would exist by its very nature. Such a prison would allow us to segregate hardened criminals from those who are hoping to establish themselves back within society.
Another consideration for such a prison is its cost effectiveness. The amount of security required would be much less in a remote area than at Millhaven or prisons in other highly populated areas.
Another compelling argument is its humaneness. 1 doubt that there are five Members here who have gone inside a special handling unit in one of our maximum security prisons. Our committee examined the prisons of this country. A special handling unit is a cell that does not have a window and may have one light. There is not even a window in the door. It is a desperate situation for a human to be in.
Studies have shown that that sort of inhumane treatment can be avoided in these special type of prisons. Those prisoners have more opportunity to move freely. In fact, there are some cases in which there are colonies where families can live with these prisoners. At the same time society is protected from those who will be desperate if they get out again.
Let me close by dealing with something which I, as a private Member, believe to be almost even more important than the subject matter of this motion. It concerns the reason why I believe the Government should accept this motion today.
There are basically three reasons. Without a doubt, I think that all of us in the House, including the Government, agree that our criminal justice system is inadequate. I think this has been expressed by the Prime Minister and the Solicitor General. While they may have different approaches to the subject, they have acknowledged the need to study the criminal justice system.
We are now getting increased pressure from the public to make such a review. This is evident in my constituency and it is evident in the House from a number of private Members' Bills calling for a return to capital punishment.
I think it is time that Parliament did something to indicate our concern about what is happening in the criminal justice system and recognized the need to tighten certain aspects of it.
The second point I want to make, which I believe was alluded to by the Leaders of all Parties during the election, is the need for greater authority and recognition to be given to private Members in the House. It is time that private Members were listened to more often.
I can see no harm in allowing an innocuous motion like this that only calls for the study of the feasibility of doing something. It does not permit the Government to do anything except study something. If that kind of motion cannot be accepted, then I am concerned about the role of the private Member in this House.
Finally, if I may have half a minute more, let me say that in this motion we have an opportunity for this House and the Government, if it will accept and pass it, to study some alternatives to capital punishment, for example, the establishment of an institution in some remote area where the public of Canada will be protected.

I recognize that the Hon. Member in his proposal is very sincere and that what he is advocating, in his own words, is only a study and there is no harm in doing a study. I am nevertheless worried about the signals put out by this kind of study which may result in the construction of something which is a crossbreed between Alcatraz and Siberia. It is something that frightens me as a Member. It signals that we are losing faith that we can ever rehabilitate prisoners. I am frankly very worried about that thought.
Another question comes to mind, and I see the Hon. Member for the Western Arctic (Mr. Nickerson) here in the House and he must be worried: Does this mean that if someone is undesirable to one section of the country, we can send him off to another part thus indicating that that part of the country is less worthy? Does this mean that if we choose an island, say in the riding of the Minister of Justice (Mr. Crosbie), Belle Isle or some other place, that that would indicate the same message for that part of the country or any other island or remote area? I am worried about doing anything that would be that kind of signal.
We have to think why we incarcerate people. Is it solely to punish them? If the answer is yes, then surely our penal system would look different from what it is today, not that it is the greatest right now, but I would suggest that if to incarcerate people is only to punish them, we would probably still be whipping prisoners, cutting off arms, and carrying out capital punishment. We have decided as a society that that is not what we want to do with human beings. We have decided that we do not want to put people away forever and throw away the key. Even contemplating such an idea would indicate that we are abandoning the hope of rehabilitating people and that we have decided life has no value for certain human beings. In my view and belief, that is very wrong.
One could say that I am a soft touch or that I have a bleeding heart, but I am of the view that there is no life not worth saving. There is value in each and every one of us. If there is such a value, as I believe there is, then we need not think any further whether or not this scheme is feasible or whether we should study it any further.
November 29, 1984

I say no to capital punishment. I say no to throwing away the key. I say no to any kinds of schemes with similar results. I say yes to reform of our penal system. I say there is a better way. But the ultimate objective of that better way is surely not to dispose of human beings, it is to make them more worthwhile. It is to make things more meaningful for them and eventually for all of society.
That is the extent of my remarks. They are brief but they are heartfelt. 1 do wish that all Members of this House would consider the signal and the objective of a resolution such as this.

Robinson (Burnaby):,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS-MOTIONS,PENITENTIARIES,ADVISABILITY OF ESTABLISHING MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON FOR THOSE SERVING LIFE SENTENCE,"Mr. Speaker, in rising to speak to the motion put forward by the Hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Halliday), I want first to pay tribute to the Hon. Member for the outstanding record he has in this area. I have had the privilege of working with the Member as a member of the Justice Committee for the last five years. I know that before that time, my colleague, the former Member for New Westminster-Coquitlam, the former justice critic for my Party, Stuart Leggatt, worked very closely with the Hon. Member for Oxford and always spoke very highly of him.
In his capacity as justice critic, Mr. Leggatt had an opportunity to serve on the subcommittee on penitentiaries, which has already been referred to by the Hon. Member for Oxford. I think it is important in addressing the substance of the motion today that we examine the content of that subcommittee report and also look at what has happened to the report since it was tabled in 1977.
That report arose from the work of the unanimous and non-partisan work of a group of Members of Parliament who were appointed to look into conditions in the Canadian penitentiary system because of some very serious incidents of violence in the system. These incidents occurred in a variety of areas whether Kingston, Laval or other areas. The subcommittee found that the penitentiary system was in a state of crisis at the time they reported. The sub-committee said that unless its recommendations were acted upon and acted upon urgently, that state of crisis would continue.
1 think the Member for Oxford has clearly documented the fact that unfortunately a succession of Solicitors General did not act upon those fundamental recommendations. I will mention Attorneys General as well. I refer to Attorneys General because surely one of the most fundamental recommendations made by that subcommittee was a recommendation that first and foremost in the Canadian criminal justice system we must look at alternatives to imprisonment. That recommendation has been shown to be so very true. The recommendation which that committee made six or seven years ago has been clearly brought out by the experience we have seen since that time. I deeply regret that governments, and I must say governments both Liberal and Conservative, have failed to respond to that very fundamental recommendation.
If we are going to be serious about reform of the criminal justice system and reform of the penal system, we must recognize that our prisons are far too crowded. There are
Maximum Security Prison
literally thousands of people in the Canadian prison system. Instead of serving time behind walls, they should be repaying their debt to society in other non-custodial ways. There are many reasons for that. One can look solely at it from an economic perspective and note that last year the statistics show that in the most recent year for which there were comprehensive statistics, that is 1980 to 1981, governments collectively spent some S845 million on the delivery of adult correctional services.
What is the comparative cost of imprisonment as opposed to non-custodial forms of supervision, community supervision, for example? The per capita cost to Canadians was nine times as high for imprisonment as it was for non-custodial forms of supervision. These alternatives to imprisonment could include fine options, fines geared to income, and community work service. Instead of the community being required to pay some $40,000 to $50,000 per year to incarcerate an individual, he is repaying his debt to society. It can include restitution to the victim of the crime.
There are a variety of other options to imprisonment. We have seen in the country partly as a result of the mandatory 25-year provisions, the compromise made at the time of the debate on capital punishment, prisons which are rapidly becoming overcrowded institutions; indeed, they already are far too crowded. We will have to come to grips with the reality that 25-year minimum sentences will have to be re-examined. If they are not, I predict that we will see serious problems in the very near future.
Overcrowding has a devastating impact on the prison system. We have already looked at the implications of double-bunking within the prison system. We have seen a dramatic rise in violence within the prison system over the last couple of years, whether it be suicides, violence by prisoner against prisoner or indeed violence by prisoner against guard. We have seen the tragedy of Archambault where a number of guards were killed. The level of that violence will surely increase unless we in this Parliament come to grips with the fact that the prison system in Canada has failed.
In the future, in 10 or 20 or 30 years, Canadians will look back on the prison system as one of the most dramatic failures in the criminal justice system. We will ask ourselves as citizens how it was that we could possibly tolerate a system which so demonstrably failed to meet its objectives. We know all too well that there is no serious attempt to rehabilitate in many institutions.
Another critical recommendation of the subcommittee was that there should be meaningful opportunities for work in institutions. I believe a national prison industries program was suggested. That recommendation has not been implemented by a succession of governments. Instead of incarcerating people for lengthy terms without any possibility of rehabilitation, we should be looking at the opportunity for meaningful and effective work for people who are in fact imprisoned.

November 29, 1984
Maximum Security Prison
The motion before the House arises as a result of the recommendations of the subcommittee on penitentiaries in 1977. Indeed it is similar to-although it is not in the same terms-recommendation 63 of the subcommittee. I have listened with great interest to the comments of the Hon. Member for Oxford and of the Hon. Member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell (Mr. Boudria) on this motion. I think a number of very important concerns were raised. In proposing the adoption of this motion, I believe the Hon. Member for Oxford said that there were two primary motives. One was the protection of society, and the second was the need to improve the criminal justice ssytem. I do not think any Member of the House would disagree with those being fundamental objectives of the criminal justice system and the penal system in the country.
We have to ask ourselves carefully whether the implementation of this motion would achieve those objectives and, if so, what would be the other implications of the motion. One of the concerns I would raise with respect to the motion and the way in which it is framed-and I know the Hon. Member is aware of this-is that in many instances prisoners sentenced to terms of life imprisonment are in fact the least disruptive or the best prisoners, in a sense, within institutions. I have consistently heard from guards, wardens and indeed other prisoners that lifers recognize that they have a term of life imprisonment. Life means life. There are many misconceptions about that. It means that after a certain term of years one is eligible for parole. That is all it means-eligible for parole. In most cases these people simply want to do their time quietly and without causing disruption in the institution. It is some of the other elements in prison-at Kent Institution, for example, the elements they call the bikers, the punks and people serving terms of shorter duration for break and enter and crimes of that nature-who have tended to be more involved in violent and disruptive acts within institutions.
To suggest that those people who are sentenced to life imprisonment might pose a greater threat to society-I do not accept that the evidence bears that out. If we are talking about the protection of society, I believe those people are serving their terms within maximum security institutions. I do not think that moving lifers to another part of the country, whether it is the Northwest Territories-and I am sure we will hear a word or two on that suggestion from the Hon. Member for Western Arctic (Mr. Nickerson)-or another area, will result in enhanced security to the community. By and large they are not the people who would pose a threat to the community in the institutions in which they are presently located.
What about the second objective, the need to improve the criminal justice system? Will this in fact achieve that objective? I have some serious concerns about that. In effect, we are banishing these individuals to a term of imprisonment in a remote area. Having said that, I recognize the intent of the Hon. Member's motion. I think the intent is worthwhile. I believe it is that in that kind of environment the opportunity would be greater for the individual not to have such a restrictive environment.
The Hon. Member asked how many Members of the House have actually been inside a cell in a special handling unit. I have certainly visited special handling units. They are inhumane and degrading institutions which I do not think play any part in a civilized criminal justice system. The motive of the Hon. Member in seeking to replace those institutions, those wings or those special handling units, with another type of institution is good. I share the concern which he has expressed with respect to those institutions. However, 1 wonder whether we are in fact adopting the correct approach by substituting banishment to a remote area for those admittedly defective institutions.
As well, I wonder about the implications in terms of support networks for prisoners. Even though they may be serving terms of life imprisonment, there is an opportunity for some of them-and we do not know how many-to be released on parole at some point. If they are to be released, surely the kind of support networks which are essential for release must be present. They must have a network which is not literally thousands of miles away but which is closer, whether it be family, friends or an opportunity for half-way houses. I suppose the Hon. Member might argue that individuals in that category could presumably be transferred closer to their families and closer to the communities in which they would ultimately live. I would certainly want to see that element studied carefully before such a proposal were to be adopted.
Ultimately, I believe that what the Hon. Member is seeking is not unreasonable. He is seeking an assurance that in dealing with the small number of prisoners within the federal system who are presumably designated by institutions-and in some cases presumably voluntarily-as people who will likely be serving lengthy sentences, those sentences should be served in the most humane manner possible. I remind Hon. Members of the House that the sentence is to deprivation of liberty. So often we forget that that is the sentence, that we should not be going beyond that and depriving prisoners of their other human rights as well.
Let me say in closing that the motion calls upon the Government to study this question. That is very much in keeping with the suggestion of the subcommittee on penitentiaries in 1977. As long as it is clearly understood that what we are seeking is a study and that many of the questions which have been raised with respect to this proposal will be addressed, I certainly think that such a study would be appropriate. I do not belive that it should in any way be construed as the first and most important priority in the criminal justice system, but in so far as it attempts to deal with the problem, which is a serious problem, it is worthy of support.

Member for Oxford (Mr. Halliday) for drawing the attention of the House to the problem of prison inmates with long-term sentences, including
November 29, 1984

those sentenced to life imprisonment. My government is aware that this particular group of inmates, whose numbers are growing, is becoming a difficult issue for Canada's Correctional Service and for the penal system in general. Although the problems are complex, they are not always clearly defined, and as a result, they will not be as easy to solve as the motion may lead us to believe.
Of course, long-term offenders and those sentenced to life imprisonment have always been a part of prison populations, in Canada and the rest of the world. However, since they were incarcerated, they have never been deemed to be a specific risk or particularly dangerous. On the contrary, Correctional Service authorities have found that in their experience, ""lifers"", as they are commonly referred to, are among the most settled and stable elements of the prison population. In fact, it is often said they have a stabilizing effect on younger and less mature inmates.
Mr. Speaker, exhaustive studies conducted both in Canada and abroad have regularly demonstrated that the conditional release of inmates sentenced to life imprisonment involves very little risk. Recently, the National Parole Board published the results of a study which followed the progress of 308 paroled lifers for twelve years, from 1970 to 1981.

The failure rate was only 6.5 per cent, less than half the average rate of 15 per cent.
These conclusions do not diminish the seriousness of the crimes of which these individuals were convicted, nor do they question the appropriateness of the severe sentences they were given. However, they do indicate it may not be advisable to earmark what would probably be very considerable sums of money for the construction of maximum security penitentiaries in remote areas, specifically for this group of inmates.
Maximum Security Prison
With respect to the small minority in that group of exceptionally dangerous inmates, the Correctional Service has very appropriate means to control their behaviour. Canada's maximum security institutions are second to none in the world. Using modern technology, the Correctional Service has improved or will soon improve security around the main institutions. In addition, the establishment of special detention units is one more way to isolate and control the more violent inmates in an institution.
Even though it is not urgent at this time to take special security measures concerning lifers and other inmates serving long sentences, the Solicitor General's department remains concerned about their particular needs and the problems they cause.
The question of long jail sentences was the focus of attention in 1976 after the adoption of Criminal code amendments and the introduction of the concept of first- and second-degree murder.
As Hon. Members surely know, first degree murder now results in a mandatory life sentence, with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
As to second-degree murder, it also calls for a life sentence, but in that case the inmate may be paroled after a minimum of ten years, although the courts can raise that minimum to 25 years.
Mr. Speaker, such lengthy jail sentences have given a new dimension to the correctional system. Before that, an inmate would seldom serve that much time behind bars. It seems that those sentences might have a new impact on both the inmate population and the correctional system.
Some people have been wondering whether long sentences might not make inmates desperate and more dangerous since they would conclude that since they have nothing to lose, they can resort to violence in the institution or even attempt to escape. Fortunately, I can say with confidence that, so far, nothing has given currency to that belief.
On the other hand, some people fear that such harsh sentences, whether they are served by lifers or by inmates with long sentences of limited duration, might have demoralizing consequences on prisoners on the psychological, social and even physical levels. That issue has been under consideration and research is continuing, although the findings so far are equivocal: although they do not dismiss the possibility of demoralizing consequences, they do not confirm that they are inevitable, nor do they predict their exact nature.
We are therefore faced with many important questions which still remain answered about the nature of the problems these inmates will have to face in the prison system. These questions will become increasingly relevant as the number of prisoners, especially lifers, increases as it certainly will. Since it is inevitable that the number of lifers will increase, our

November 29, 1984
Maximum Security Prison
prisons should house at least 2,000 murderers in the first degree by the year 2000.
The Government, and especially the Solicitor General, is considering these issues actively as well as some initiatives which would solve problems before they occur. Special establishments with limited access and high security or simply specialized correctional facilities, are among the options available. We shall continue to examine schemes such as those mentioned in the motion, but for the moment, we are far from being in agreement about the merit of such an approach.
The Department of the Solicitor General has created a departmental committee on lengthy incarceration made up of representatives of the Correctional Service Canada, the National Parole Board, as well as the Research and Corrections Policy Divisions of the Ministry Secretariat. This committee must consider every operational alternative. In addition, it coordinates the extremely varied activities of the Department with a view to studying the problems facing this group of inmates and to take the necessary action to prevent and solve these problems. The committee will publish, in the very near future in fact, its first working paper which for the first time will give out information on this group of inmates and which will be used to develop the necessary guidelines and programs. 1 also wish to draw the attention of Hon. Members to the October 1984 issue of the Canadian Criminology Review. That special issue deals exclusively with present research on longterm imprisonment. It reflects the interest generated by the review the Solicitor General initiated. The articles and studies in that periodical provide useful information on that very important matter and remind us that we have still much to learn.
In the Department of the Solicitor General, research is made on various important points, namely the adjustment of prisoners to long sentences, their behaviour in jail, the problems they face, the difficulties met by institutions which must make proper programs available to lifers and possible housing alternatives within institutions and special facilities.
Mr. Speaker, as a result of those efforts, steps will be taken to continue to protect the public, and the staff and prisoners in Canadian penitentiaries. If special facilities such as those mentioned in the motion or any other kind of institution are felt to be necessary, action will be taken in due time, but that time has not come yet.
I suggest that this interesting proposal put forward by the Hon. Member be considered as an alternative by the government. Considering the research and the high costs involved by such a proposal, it should not be considered offhand as the only alternative available.

I would like to thank the Hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Halliday) for bringing this very interesting idea forward once again. As he said in his introduction, it is not something new.
I think the difficulty that we have in putting something like this into operation is that it entails a radical change in thinking. The traditional Canadian point of view was expressed very well by the Hon. Member for Burnaby (Mr. Robinson). Had we in Canada the same type of penal traditions as exist for instance in the U.S.S.R., our attitude might be different and we would not have these half-studies that recommend that the thing be put on the back burner for a while.
Apart from that mind-set, there are some other difficulties with this idea. One of those difficulties is the issue of costs. There is a very small local jail in Frobisher Bay. 1 believe it costs something like $150 a day to keep someone in that minimum security facility. There are many transportation costs involved in taking prisoners and staff back and forth. There is the cost of heating to be borne if we are to keep prisoners in the manner to which they have become accustomed in southern Canada. Another difficulty that is encountered is the matter of staff. If there were to be a facility in a very remote location, presumably we would have to take staff in for a week and then back out for a week.
Whenever a penitentiary is proposed for a certain location, whether it be in southern or northern Canada, the natural reaction of the local population is to say: 'No, we do not want all these guys in our community1. The initial reaction to this idea in the Territories is not in any way any different from the reactions in southern Canada. When some thought is given to the matter in a little more detail, as has happened in a couple of communities, the attitude changes somewhat. What I would really like to do is to put on the record the requests made by a couple of communities in my constituency that are actively looking at the idea of soliciting a federal penitentiary for their areas.
The first such town is Fort Smith in which there already is a territorial jail for females and a facility for young offenders. The people of Fort Smith have the support base in that there is a college there and the area is semi-remote. They do have a daily jet service and there is a road that goes to Fort Smith, so we are not faced with the difficulties of a very remote location. If the population could be assured that such a facility would be a secure facility, they would likely welcome the idea. As I said before, they are accustomed to penal institutions and there is a very small economic base in the community. They would like to encourage that type of thing.
The second location that has expressed an interest in having a federal penitentiary is the Town of Pine Point. The Chamber of Commerce, under the presidency of a gentleman by the name of Mr. Ward Lynds, to whom I was speaking only a few days ago, is actively pursuing the idea and would like it to be discussed by the municipal authorities so that it will eventually have the support of the entire community. That is another location which is what might be called semi-remote. The local
November 29, 1984

Chamber of Commerce presents a very good argument as to why a federal penitentiary should be built in that location.
In order to allow my friend on the opposite side to make a few concluding remarks, Mr. Speaker, I will thank you for the opportunity to make my views known and will resume my seat.

Nunziata (York South-Weston):,,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS-MOTIONS,PENITENTIARIES,ADVISABILITY OF ESTABLISHING MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON FOR THOSE SERVING LIFE SENTENCE,"Mr. Speaker, if I may, I will begin by applauding the Hon. Member who moved the motion for his position on capital punishment. I appreciate that the intent behind his motion is to find an alternative to capital punishment. I would like to state for the record that I am unequivocally opposed to capital punishment and I share my friend's concerns with respect to the inevitability of the return of capital punishment if the matter is brought before this House again. In fact, I fear that if the matter were voted upon in this House, the motion would carry. Accordingly, I think we ought to do everything possible to find some alternative to capital punishment.
There is no question in my mind that it will be a very sad day indeed for this nation if capital punishment is returned to the law books of the country. It will set our country back and will indicate to the world that we are returning to the law of the jungle and that this country is uncivilized, indecent and inhumane. I certainly urge Hon. Members to give it some very lengthy thought before they speak quickly and advocate the return of capital punishment.
The Hon. Member is suggesting that a penal institution be established in a remote area of the country. I have some serious difficulties with respect to the Hon. Member's logic, although I do not for one moment question his sincerity. On the one hand, he speaks of the protection of society and the rehabilitation of inmates. I cannot imagine how a penal colony in some remote portion of the country will assist in the rehabilitation of an inmate who is serving a lengthy sentence of life imprisonment. I agree whole heartedly with my colleague, the Hon. Member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell (Mr. Boudria), who says that life is sacred. Human life is sacred, and to banish semone to a penal colony would eliminate any hope that that person might have of some day resuming his or her law-abiding life.
I do not quarrel with the spirit of the Hon. Member's motion but, once again, I have very serious difficulties with respect to its logic. The Government ought first to determine what is the purpose of incarceration. It seems to me that the paramount purpose of incarceration is the protection of society. The second purpose of incarceration is the rehabilitation of the inmate.
I see, Mr. Speaker, that the time has expired. I would urge Hon. Members not to support the motion.

(B) CONSULTATION QUERY,,"Mr. Speaker, on November 26 I put a question to the Minister of the Environment (Mrs. Blais-Grenier) concerning the decision of the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), announced in his Economic Statement, to cancel the construction of the Toxicology Centre at the University of Guelph and the University of Toronto. I asked the Minister why the centre, which is so important to the development of new information, research in toxicology and to the training of people in Canada would be cancelled by the Government.
This centre has been in the making for some ten years. A sub-committee of the National Research Council and an associated committee on toxicology have been working for ten years to put together an independent centre which was to be jointly sponsored by the federal Government, the provincial Government and industry.
In responding to my question, the Minister indicated that the cost of the centre had gone from $32 million to $50 million. She suggested that it was a capital cost, and that it was the federal Government's cost. In fact, those figures are not correct. The cost to the federal Government was to be $16 million, $10 million for capital and $6 million for operational costs, and the same cost would apply to the Province. Private industry was to provide $3 million for capital cost and $5 million over a five-year period. The actual capital costs are estimated to be between $20 million and $23 million. Those figures have remained fairly constant. It was to be a centre of excellence for toxicology research and training. It was associated with two universities in order that post-graduate degrees in toxicology could be provided.
There is massive concern in the population with respect to toxicology and toxins associated with cancer. Dr. Emmanual Farber, Chairman of the Board at the University of Toronto Toxicology Centre, is a pathologist in cancer research. When we turn on our television sets we are informed about concern with insecticides and with toxic chemicals in the Niagara River. The Government had a chance to spend $10 million in capital and $6 million in operating costs over a five-year period and, together with industry, the province and two universities, would have made a world-class facility. It is simply criminal that the Government took this decision.
The most disturbing part is that the Minister obviously had not read her briefing notes and had no idea about the whole project. The figures she used were erroneous. If the figures are

November 29, 1984
Adjournment Debate
not right, then we can question whether the Minister really tried to fight for the institution. It was not only a federal decision, it involved the Province, universities and the private sector. The Government talks blithely about involving the private sector. The private sector was willing to provide substantial funds for this project. We must wonder whether the Minister knew about the project.
We note daily on our television sets concerns regarding toxins in health, consumer products, industry and manufacturing. The Minister suggested that $700,000 was being spent on research into toxicology. The people I talked to at the University of Guelph said that they would be surprised if there was even 10 per cent of that amount. There may be $700,000 in research but certainly not $700,000 a year for research into toxicology.
This Government blithely talks about consultation. I defy the Minister to say there was consultation with the University of Guelph, the University of Toronto, the Province of Ontario or private industry before the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) stood in his place and cancelled this institution. There simply was no consultation.
When we combine the cut-backs in the Canadian Wildlife Service and the cut-backs in monitoring of toxins in Lake Ontario and other places, Mr. Speaker, we see a government which is not dedicated to preserving the environment. Certainly it is not interested in the development of the University of Guelph or the University of Toronto in that regard. It is certainly not a friend of those universities or the City of Guelph in this whole matter because there were some 160 jobs involved in this project over the long haul. I just hope the Minister will reconsider this action and re-establish this institution.

Suzanne Blais-Grenier (Minister of the Environment):,Minister of the Environment,PROCEEDINGS ON ADJOURNMENT MOTION,RESEARCH-PROPOSED TOXICOLOGY CENTRE PROJECT. (B) CONSULTATION QUERY,,"Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity of responding to the Hon. Member opposite. I stand by the figures I have indicated to this House these last few days, and here are additional data that certainly should be of interest to my hon. colleague.
In its 1982 study of federal programs on toxic chemicals, the Treasury Board made known the following facts: During the fiscal year 1981-82, more than 2,600 person-years and $143 million were committed, of which 450 person-years and $20 million were for research purposes.
Twenty four government departments have undertaken research work on toxic chemicals in compliance with 58 acts of Parliament.
One item that was criticized by the study was the lack of an overall, consistent program in that area. There was concern among other things about work duplication, and apparently no overall policy or priority had been developed in that respect.
Major recommendations were made in that study, namely the need for a consistent, coordinated and efficient harmonization of efforts, through the establishment of a Canadian inter-departmental committee on toxic chemicals.
Clearly, Mr. Speaker, this Government has absolutely no intention of withdrawing from or relinquishing its important role in the area of studies and research on toxic chemicals.
But again let me say that the $16 million the Canadian Government would have invested in the building of the Guelph Centre were indeed millions of dollars that would have been going into construction work rather than into actual research activities.
Therefore, it is false to suggest that Canadian research and expertise on toxic chemicals are reduced by such a cut. Quite the opposite, we are still increasing our funding for the building of such expert research facilities, and we are committed to increasing that research expertise on toxic chemicals, despite the difficulties resulting from the current economic situation.
In my view, Mr. Speaker, there should be an end to all that ideological nonsense with respect to that matter, and there should also be an end to the efforts to scare Canadians into believing this is being curtailed.

(B) INQUIRY CONCERNING EMPLOYMENT FOR LAID-OFF WORKERS",,"Mr. Speaker, my question on November 16 of this year was directed to the Hon. Minister of the Environment and concerned employment at Kouchibouguac National Park.
The Park's history goes back several years, when, in order to create the park, it was necessary to expropriate some 200 families, and subsequently force them to move. Mr. Speaker, this was not a very happy time in our history. Of course, compensation was received for loss of property and for moving expenses, but more important, promises were made and especially a commitment that things would improve. Commitment is the key word here. A commitment was made to create jobs for these people who had been forced to move out. Since then we have been able to employ about 200 people every year, and I am referring to seasonal workers, not to the government employees responsible for park administration. Seasonal employees are mostly engaged in various construction projects such as walkways to the beaches, nature paths, camping and picnic areas, ski huts, and so forth.
Much remains to be done. Work on park facilities is still going on. In fact, we could employ about 200 seasonal workers for several years more, and seasonal jobs are very much in demand. Kouchibouguac National Park is the main employer in this area and has been for some time.
November 29, 1984

Since work on the park was started, some 200 families have depended on this seasonal work. But now, all of a sudden, the Hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) is announcing cutbacks that will affect the work on facilities in national parks.
When I asked the Hon. Minister of the Environment how these cutbacks would affect the people in my riding, I was told that not only will seasonal workers be affected but also that her Department intends to cut 305 person-years in the Department itself. I was also told that seven people in my riding will be losing their jobs, and I am referring to people working for the Canadian Wildlife Service in Sackville, but I will get back to that later. I must say the people in my riding are getting a pretty rough deal!
To get back to the jobs in the National Park, I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply. If the Government persists in cutting these jobs, it will be putting these families in a very difficult, not to say untenable situation, but it will also mean failure to meet commitments made to these people, commitments we have met since the Park's inception. No other sector in our economy can provide jobs for these people if they are not rehired. Even if the Hon. Minister claims that her Department's prime objective is not to create jobs, I would urge the Minister to review her position on cutbacks in national parks.
The commitment made by the Government to the people of Kouchibouguac, a commitment to maintain employment levels, must be met. Mr. Speaker, in doing so, the Hon. Minister would be keeping a promise made during the election campaign, which was to create thousands of jobs.

We are going to have to tighten our belts to balance the budget and everybody will feel the pinch. I am sure that some people in the riding of my colleague will also have to suffer.
As far as the Kouchibouguac Park is concerned, we have actually spent more than $25 million to develop, maintain and operate the park since it was first opened 15 years ago. At this point in time, most of the development projects have been completed. Sure enough, lots of jobs were available last year at Kouchibouguac, but they did not have anything to do with environment programs. For instance, they were created under Unemployment Insurance Act Section 38, the Environment 2000 program-a pilot project which has now ended-Canada Works and the summer employment program.
My department now expects to open up 73 jobs in the Kouchibouguac Park next summer, 56 fewer than last year. But other jobs will be available under job creation programs as they are announced. My colleague the Minister of Employ-

ment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald) has already announced that funds have been set aside for job creation, and I am sure that some of that money will be spent in the riding of the Hon. Member.

Robinson (Burnaby):,,PROCEEDINGS ON ADJOURNMENT MOTION,CHILDREN-SEXUAL ABUSE-BADGLEY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS. (B) GOVERNMENT POSITION,,"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on this occasion to follow up on questions I raised with the Minister of Justice (Mr. Crosbie) and the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) on November 8 with respect to the implementation of the recommendations of the Badgley Report on the sexual abuse of children.
The Badgley Commission was appointed in December of 1980. The report which was released in August of 1984, after over three years of study, documented what was unquestionably a national tragedy. Unfortunately, it is a national tragedy in which the victims are too often silent and traumatized.
The terms of reference of the Badgley Commission were to document the extend of child sexual abuse and recommend how young victims could be better protected; to consider how juvenile prostitution could be prevented and to determine the extent of the making of child pornography. After very extensive research, the committee came up with some very disturbing findings. I would like to take a couple of minutes to document the most serious of those findings.
For example, the committee found that at some time during their lives, about one in two females and one in three males have been victims of one or more unwanted sexual acts. These acts included being exposed to, being sexually threatened, being touched on a sexual part of the body and attempts to assault or being sexually assaulted. About four in five of these unwanted sexual acts have been first committed against these persons when they were children or youths. Four in 100 young females have been raped. Two in 100 young persons have experienced attempts or actual acts on unwanted anal penetration by a penis or by means of objects or fingers.
Acts of exposure constituted the largest single category of sexual offences committed against children. Cases were documented where such acts were followed by sexual assault.
The other major findings included the fact that three in five sexually abused children had also been threatened or physically coerced by their assailants. Young victims are as likely to be threatened or forced to engage in sexual acts by persons relatively close in age as by older persons.
A few young victims were physically injured but substantially more suffered emotional harm or trauma. About one in four of the assailants was a family member or a person in a position of trust. About half were friends or acquaintances and about one in six was a stranger. Virtually all of the assailants were males while one in 100 were female.
The final major report was that over two in five of all sexual assault homocides are committed against children 15 and younger. Children are the victims of three in four convicted

sexual offenders found to be dangerous on sentencing by the courts.
This is a shocking report in the extent to which it documents child and sexual abuse in Canada. It is a 1,300 page indictment of governments, both provincial and federal, for having failed to respond to what is clearly a national tragedy.
It is particularly appropriate as we approach the international year of youth that this government be called upon to make a commitment, a commitment to Canada's young people, that this problem, this crisis of child sexual abuse will be dealt with, and dealt with in a serious and responsible way. The extent and scope of the problem has been clearly and eloquently documented by the Badgley Commission. They have made a number of recommendations which touch on both provincial and federal jurisdictions, Mr. Speaker.
I was most disappointed to note that the Throne Speech made no reference whatsoever to the report of the Badgley Commission on Child Sexual Abuse. I can only hope that the rather more general commitment in the Throne Speech to assistance to victims of family violence will also include immediate attention to the victims of child sexual abuse.
One of the most urgent recommendations of the Badgley Commission Report is the establishment of the office of a special commissioner who would report directly to the Prime Minister. Similar offices have been created in response to concerns in the areas of human rights and the status of women. The Government of Canada has established special bodies to respond to concerns in that area. The Badgley Commission Report recommended that the Government of Canada should establish an office of the commissioner reporting directly to the office of the Prime Minister which could be assigned the authority to review the many recommendations of the Badgley Commission Report, and basically serve as an agency which would initiate and co-ordinate the reforms which are called for at the federal level, and also ensure that both provincial governments and municipal governments respond as is appropriate.
In response to my question, the Minister of Justice indicating that he would be meeting with his colleagues at the provincial level in St. John's, I believe, on November 23, and meet they did. Arising from that meeting with his colleagues there was no reference whatever in the communique, certainly no public reference, to the very serious problems which were documented by the report of the Badgley Commission.
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada (Mr. Speyer) will rise and give the House some indication of what the response will be of the Government both to these recommendations and the urgent recommendation with respect to the establishment of an office of the commissioner to co-ordinate the Government's response at the federal level.
This report cries out for action, and action now. There are no children in the House of Commons, but we have a special
trust and a special obligation to speak on their behalf, Mr. Speaker.

(B) GOVERNMENT POSITION,,"Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Sexual Offences Against Children carried out a great deal of work in preparing its report which, as the Hon. Member indicated, was published on August 22, 1984. The committee was chaired by Dr. Badgley of Toronto. In fulfilling its mandate it met with concerned groups and received over 250 written submissions, as well as conducting a research program which included national surveys on sexual child abuse. I do not think the Hon. Member for Burnaby (Mr. Robinson) overstates the case when he says the report is highly disturbing to anybody with any sensitivity.
Given the multi-faced dimensions of its terms of reference, this inquiry required contributions and co-operation with the provinces, with the municipalities in the legal and social fields.
The Hon. Member for Burnaby asked what we are going to do; what this Government plans to do about the problem and the recommendations submitted to the Committee? The answer is relatively simple. The Government is going to take steps to deal with the problem and to make Canada a safer country for children. But effective changes involving many disciplines and requiring close co-operation of the three levels of government cannot take place overnight, as desirable as that may be.
For example, consider the total number of recommendations made by the committee. There are a total of 52 recommendations, of which at least 30 call for a potential federal legislative response. Changes to the Criminal Code and to the Canada Evidence Act are the responsibility of the Minister of Justice. Before these can be acted upon, it will be necessary to review each proposed change with the provinces, the Crown prosecutors' office, the defence bar and the police community. Action will be forthcoming. It will be forthcoming promptly.
Several recommendations call for the strengthening of services to children. While most of these require provincial leadership, in the case of victim compensation there is a clear overlap into federal jurisdiction. It is imperative to recognize that implementation of these recommendations is a complex undertaking. With this fact in mind, a number of steps have already been undertaken in relation to the committee's findings.
The Departments of Justice and National Health and Welfare, the Ministries of the Solicitor General and Secretary of State, and Status of Women of Canada have formed an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate the federal work. Officials of my Department consulted with the Canadian Council on Children and Youth in August, and a national consultation day in association with the Fifth International Congress on Child Abuse was held in Montreal in September. The response of non-governmental child care organizations in
November 29, 1984

the provinces is being followed up by officials in the Department of Justice. Many other actions are being taken.
Essentially the Member's point is correct. Badgley and his recommendations deserve to be treated swiftly. It is an incredibly disturbing report, and I recommend that all Members do read it.
